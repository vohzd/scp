**Item #:** SCP-5045

**Object Class:** Euclid

SCP-5045's program icon.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Webcrawler XYY-76 has been created to search for any mention of select trigger phrases (example: "Goat VR" "Goat Game" "Farmer Game"), as well as any accounts with the name "farmer", and flag them for review. The flagged phrase will be manually reviewed for SCP-5045 influence and deleted when necessary.

A single copy of SCP-5045 is kept within Terminal 577-B within Site-301.

**Description:** SCP-5045 is a virtual reality game that is compatible with most virtual reality headsets titled "Goat VR." Before discovery, SCP-5045 could be downloaded at several websites dedicated to obscure games, as well as its own website.

SCP-5045 begins with a title screen with "GOAT VR" displayed in large neon green and purple text. Below the title is a button titled "play" which, when pressed, puts the player into a cartoonish 3D environment vaguely resembling that of a neon blue farmhouse surrounded by a black void. The ground is covered in a neon green grass texture, and bounded by a blue colored picket fence which surrounds the farmhouse. Travel beyond the fence is impossible, due to an invisible barrier blocking access.

Contained within a narrow space enclosed by the fence are several animate entities resembling goats, drawn in a similar style to the surroundings. These goats exhibit simple and repetitive behavior in which they walk unimpeded until reaching a barrier, in which case they will turn around and walk in a different direction. These goats are drawn in two dimensions, appearing as a flat shape. Despite their simple stylization, however, their movements appear smooth and uniquely generated, with no use of repeating frames or walk cycles. No content related to the goats has been found in the game's files.[1](javascript:;)

Graphic of SCP-5045-1 recovered from the website "www.goatvr.███".

Within the farmhouse is a crudely drawn humanoid entity, with slightly more visual detail than the goats, hereafter designated SCP-5045-1. SCP-5045-1 refers to itself as "Farmer" and displays a degree of sapience, often attempting communication with the player and responding to verbal questioning. Despite the absence of a microphone, SCP-5045-1 is capable of detecting and understanding the player's speech, as well as, to a limited degree, loud sounds nearby.

SCP-5045-1 employs various tactics to increase playtime during a given play session. Such tactics include the generation of visual effects in the corner of the player's field of view, bleating sounds emanating from beneath various surfaces, and requests to join him in an activity such as watching the goats together. When questioned about these tactics, SCP-5045-1 unilaterally denies their existence.

After a variable amount of time, SCP-5045-1 will vocalize to the player "Thanks for playing Goat VR!" before shutting the headset off, which continues to draw power until disconnected. Upon this happening, the player falls into an indefinite vegetative state.

**\[**BEGIN LOG**\]**

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Alright, let's begin.

**D-1711:** Wait, we're starting now?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Testing begins now, yes.

**D-1711:** Okie dokie.

_D-1711 puts on the VR headset and the title screen of SCP-5045 is shown._

![log1title.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5045/log1title.jpg)

SCP-5045's title screen.

**D-1711:** Goat VR? Christ, that's a gaudy title screen. Do I really have to do this?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Yes.

**D-1711:** Things could be a lot worse, I guess…

_D-1711 moves his hand to the play button and presses it. The screen fades into black, and out into SCP-5045's central location._

**D-1711:** Huh, so this is where you guys want me to explore? Kinda small from the looks of things. Colorful too. Really colorful.

_D-1711 groans._

**D-1711:** Guys, my head's killing me already and I just started!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** This will only take ten minutes. For the record, could you describe what you are seeing?

**D-1711:** Alright… uhh, everything's all black and outlined in these bright neon colors. Not many colors actually. The ones I can list so far are blue, green, and some specks of white in the distance. Looks like a cartoon. In front of me there's this fence and a barn, both outlined in bright blue. Below me is some patchy bright green grass, and above me is darkness.

(D-1711 looks over towards the fence area of SCP-5045)

**D-1711:** I think I'm going to get closer to those little white fellas over by the fence. I can see them moving.

_D-1711 starts heading towards the blue fence, and stops as he is close enough to the fence to make out a collection of fourteen crudely drawn cartoon goats maneuvering around the area. Many of the goats are bleating. Further back, more goats can be seen, although it is hard to make out how many there are._

SCP-5045's fence area. Click to enlarge.

**D-1711:** (_laughing_) What the fuck? Is this a joke?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** No. Again, for the record, please describe in detail what you are seeing.

**D-1711:** What I'm seeing looks like, I don't know, a joke! All these goats, look like bad cartoons, wandering around, bumping into each other.

**D-1711:** I swear, there's gotta be more of those little guys back there than I can see clearly. Awww, that one over there looks scared!

_D-1711 looks to a goat from behind the fourteen goats displayed. It is difficult to make out given the resolution, but a two-dimensional goat is seen with a concerned expression on its face. Its overlarge eyes dart around frantically._

**D-1711:** Poor guy. Wonder what's got him so stressed out.

_D-1711 looks back at the fourteen goats being displayed._

**D-1711:** Honestly, this is impressive. Considering the art quality, I expected some choppy animations, but these guys are really fluid. I wish I could stay and watch, but I should probably get going to the farmhou-

_D-1711 turns to his right and sees SCP-5045-1 in front of them. D-1711 yelps, startled._

D-1711's POV upon discovering SCP-5045-1.

**SCP-5045-1:** Howdy! The name's Farmer!

**D-1711:** Gah! That scared the hell out of me!

**SCP-5045-1:** Didn't mean to frighten you! I just noticed you were admiring my prized goat collection!

**D-1711:** Wait, you can actually hear me?

**SCP-5045-1:** Clear as a bell!

**D-1711:** Is this game multiplayer or something?

**SCP-5045-1:** Say that again?

**D-1711:** Is this game multiplayer?

**SCP-5045-1:** Huh?

_D-1711 sighs._

**D-1711:** Can I just go to your farmhouse?

**SCP-5045-1:** But I haven't even gotten a chance to talk about these incredible things!

_SCP-5045-1 motions towards the goats in the fenced area of SCP-5045._

**SCP-5045-1:** They're quite the entertainers, aren't they? Look at them go!

_D-1711 turns to look at the fence and chuckles._

**D-1711:** You don't need to tell me that. God, these things are hilarious.

_SCP-5045-1 nods, smiling._

**D-1711:** Say, are there any other farm animals here that you can show me?

**SCP-5045-1:** Not a chance. Goats are all I need! They're great listeners.

_SCP-5045-1 begins pointing emotively at the goats displayed at the fence area._

**SCP-5045-1:** These ones especially! I'll show you!

_SCP-5045-1 puts his hand up to his mouth and generates a sharp whistling sound. As this happens, all fourteen goats collectively freeze in place and look directly at SCP-5045-1._

**SCP-5045-1:** Thank you! Now please, greet our new guest.

_Each goat turns their head towards D-1711 and bleats._

**SCP-5045-1:** Isn't that kind of them?

**D-1711:** Yeah that's… cool? Listen, my head's aching, can I jus- wait a minute. I hear something.

_D-1711 turns towards the fence area. A goat is dragging their head across the floor, with an irritated expression._

**D-1711:** Ummm, are they supposed to be doing that?

**SCP-5045-1:** Hey!

_SCP-5045-1 turns towards the goat, visibly angered._

**SCP-5045-1:** Am I gonna have to make you stop doing that? Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look? Second time this week! How hard is it to give people a good time, friend?

**D-1711:** Friend?

_The timer for SCP-5045 concludes and the game is shut off. D-1711 takes off his VR headset._

**D-1711:** Oh thank god. Kinda relieved to take this thing off, my head was burning up and it was starting to smell really bad in there.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Smell? How would you describe this smell?

**D-1711:** I dunno, cigarettes? Wood smoke? Couldn't really put my finger on it. Jesus, I feel itchy.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** -emember, you aren't allowed to take the headset off at any moment.

**D-6770:** Yeah yeah, whatever. You don't need to tell me twice.

_D-6770 presses the play button. The screen fades into black, and out into SCP-5045's central location._

**D-6770:** Alright, here we are.

_D-6770 shakes his head, briefly wincing._

**D-6770:** Was this game even made for VR? Looks like a laser tag arena spread to a nearby farm.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Please try to focus and enter the farmhouse. The discomforting visuals are a known factor.

**D-6770:** There's a dude in there. He isn't moving. Is he a-

**D-6770:** Jesus Christ.

**SCP-5045-1:** Hello! Farmer here! I very very much do _love_ new visitors! What brings you here?

**D-6770:** I need to get in that farmhouse.

**SCP-5045-1:** You _need_ to, do you? I appreciate the enthusiasm, but there's so much to do around here! Have you seen my goat collection?

**D-6770:** Your goat collection? That's what those things are?

**SCP-5045-1:** C'mere, you love to see 'em!

_SCP-5045-1 approaches D-6770 with an outstretched hand._

**D-6770:** Christ, don't touch me! Lemme-

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** We'd prefer it if you followed SCP-5045-1's instructions for now.

**D-6770:** Jesus, fine. I'll look at the goddamn goats.

**SCP-5045-1:** Now that's an attitude we wanna see, champ! C'mere, give 'em a look. You'll love what I've collected!

**\[Extraneous footage removed, playtime surpasses fifteen minutes.\]**

**SCP-5045-1:** And this one here is Jumbles! She's a pretty dramatic one, pay her no mind.

**D-6770:** Can I just go to the farmhouse already?

**SCP-5045-1:** Darnit, no! I haven't even taken you past the fence yet!

**D-6770:** I'm not entering your creepy goat pit!

**SCP-5045-1:** Wow, that's some good sass there! Cool off, we can check out the farmhouse you're so itchin' to explore.

_D-6770 sighs._

**D-6770:** Thank you.

Interior of SCP-5045-1's farmhouse.

_D-6770 and SCP-5045-1 walk to the farm entrance and enter inside._

**SCP-5045-1:** This is it! The farmhouse!

_D-6770 looks around the room in confusion._

**D-6770:** This is all there is? A painting and some hay? What the hell do you even do here?

**SCP-5045-1:** What were you expecting? I'd love to know.

**D-6770:** I don't know… a lot more than this?

_The screen flickers and SCP-5045-1 vanishes. Where SCP-5045-1 vanished, a door can be seen that wasn't visible before._

**D-6770:** Wh- what the fuck was that? Where did he go? What's this door doing here?

_D-6770 begins to back away from the door._

**D-6770:** Something about that door man, I don't really want to enter it. I think I'll just relax here for a bit, have some alone time and umm… watch paint dry.

_The sound of thumping and scratching begins playing throughout the walls of the farmhouse._

**D-6770:** Oh shit, what's doing that! Fuck, do I really gotta go in there?

_Cracks begin to form around the walls of the farmhouse._

**D-6770:** I'll take that as a yes!

D-6770's view of the door as it opens. Click to enlarge.

_D-6770 runs to the door as it opens without manipulation, revealing an area of grass with several random structures containing windows in the background. A purple sign is stuck out of the grass with the phrase "ENJOY!" pasted on it. A yellow figure can be seen briefly in the window of a red, silo like structure, who quickly ducks out of view in an apparent panic. Once D-6770 enters, the door behind him shuts, and a giggling sound is heard from behind._

**D-6770:** Christ! This virtual reality stuff is immersive as hell man, I felt like I was in danger.

_D-6770 looks back at the door._

**D-6770:** Shit, I guess I'm stuck here now. No way I'm going back in there after that happened! What's up with that sign? "ENJOY?" I'm really hoping that Farmer freak isn't around right now. He gives me the absolute willies.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** What do you plan on doing now?

**D-6770:** Well, what's the use of being stuck somewhere and not exploring it? I'm thinking of heading over that weird red tower thing, I swear I saw some yellow dude up there when I was entering that door. Alright, let's go.

_D-6770 begins walking towards the red silo structure._

**\[Extraneous footage removed, playtime surpasses twenty-five minutes.\]**

**D-6770:** Alright, I think I'm almost there, I can see the tower pretty close now.

**D-6770:** Does anyone else think the ground feels kinda scratchy right now?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Could you describe this sensation in more detail?

**D-6770:** I don't know, I guess the ground just feels kinda like steel wool. God, I hate it. It's awfu- oh, I made it!

_D-6770 has reached the red silo. The silo is featureless, except for a door on the front and a window on the top._

**D-6770:** Well, here's hoping I meet someone less freaky this time around.

_D-6770 enters the door into a featureless room with a spiral staircase. Panicked breathing and talking can be heard from above D-6770._

**D-6770:** Who the hell is up there?

**D-6770:** I guess there's only one way to find out, huh.

_D-6770 begins climbing up the spiral staircase._

**D-6770:** You know, at least it's a little calmer in here than out there. I was starting to get a headache from all the noise and color. It's kinda chill here, in spite of that damn breathing I'm hearing right now. Ground doesn't feel scratchy anymore.

_D-6770 climbs to the top of the steps and reaches a circular area with a single window and a yellow humanoid entity (who will hereby be mentioned as SCP-5045-2), who is facing away from D-6770. SCP-5045-2 is shaking and talking to himself unintelligibly._

**D-6770:** Oh shit, uhh, you good man?

_SCP-5045-2 shrieks and turns to face D-6770._

**SCP-5045-2:** Come any closer and I- Oh!

**D-6770:** Excuse me?

**SCP-5045-2:** Shit. I'm sorry, you scared the hell out of me. I… I have to keep a clear head, I can't panic right now. Who are you? You don't look like him at all.

**D-6770:** My name is ████████. What's yours?

**SCP-5045-2:** I dunno… what my name is? I don't know how to… I can't tell you much, I think. Are you stuck here too?

**D-6770:** Stuck?

**SCP-5045-2:** Fuck, what am I saying? I haven't even… fuck! My head!

**D-6770:** Do you wanna leave or something?

**SCP-5045-2:** I don't know, I feel safer here? Don't feel seen in here? I don't know why, I just do.

**D-6770:** Well, obviously you aren't safe in here, cause I just walked in without you even noticing.

**SCP-5045-2:** Oh… that's a good point. Oh shit, you're right! Why was I ever feeling safe! Oh god!

**D-6770:** Uhm, calm down! Things are going to be… ok? I…? God, this is weird.

**SCP-5045-2:** It _is_ fucking weird! I don't have a fucking clue why this is happening to me!

**D-6770:** What exactly is happening to you?

**SCP-5045-2:** Wait, no! You shouldn't leave.

**D-6770:** Huh?

**SCP-5045-2:** You make me feel clearer, if that makes sense. I haven't talked to someone in a while. Fuck, I thought I'd never see anyone here who could talk… other than him.

**D-6770:** You mean Farmer?

**SCP-5045-2:** Y- yeah…

**D-6770:** God damn it, knew there was something off about that obnoxious creep. The hell does he want from you?

**SCP-5045-2:** I don't know, and I don't even want to know… I don't think this is a matter of me though, this might be a matter of us.

**D-6770:** You wanna just go?

**SCP-5045-2:** Sure. Let's get out of here.

**\[Extraneous footage removed, playtime surpasses thirty-five minutes.\]**

_D-6770 and SCP-5045-2 are walking together in a plane of grass. There are several structures in the background around them in various shapes and colors. The two are heading towards an area which seems to have no structures at all. SCP-5045-2 is leading the way._

**D-6770:** And why are we heading here exactly?

**SCP-5045-2:** There's gotta be an end or something.

**D-6770:** Where do you think an "end" is going to take you anyway?

**SCP-5045-2:** I just hope it's anywhere that doesn't look like here. I hope it's home, why do I hope it's home?

**D-6770:** Why wouldn't you hope it's home?

**SCP-5045-2:** I think he's making m- Wait, I see something over there.

_A squiggly thin blue fence can be seen from afar. From behind, several goats can be seen._

**SCP-5045-2:** Oh no.

**D-6770:** Is that another fence? Oh god, that's definitely another fence.

**SCP-5045-2:** Oh god, we're back to the start, aren't we!

**D-6770:** This can't be the start, I don't remember these goats… or the fence looking like that.

**D-6770:** Holy shit! That one is huge!

_D-6770 and SCP-5045-2 both walk towards the fence to get a better view of the goats._

Several goats through the POV of D-6770.

**D-6770:** God damn, that's massive.

**SCP-5045-2:** I hope it's doing ok.

**D-6770:** What on earth are those things sticking out of it? Jesus, is that puke?

**SCP-5045-2:** Don't think about it too hard, it hurts to think hard here.

**D-6770:** Should we just walk along the fence line? That seems to be the only other choice we have, unless you want more empty buildings to explore.

**SCP-5045-2:** Sure. I don't want to look at the goats though.

**D-6770:** It's not like I'm making you.

_D-6770 and SCP-5045-2 begin walking along the fence. Several goats of varying sizes and shapes pass them by._

**D-6770:** Why are you so uncomfortable around them anyway?

**SCP-5045-2:** They remind me of Farmer, and I rather not think about him. I have to focus on getting out of here!

**D-6770:** Wait, are you another player?

**SCP-5045-2:** Y- yeah? I think?

**D-6770:** Can't you just take the headset off then?

**SCP-5045-2:** Headset?

**D-6770:** You know, the VR headset thingy! It's attached to your head, right?

**SCP-5045-2:** Why does that… sound so familiar?

_SCP-5045-2 grabs at its head and begins tugging._

**SCP-5045-2:** Where is it? I can't feel anything.

**D-6770:** I… guess you're not a player then?

**SCP-5045-2:** No, I have to be! Those words you said, I swear I know them! I just… can't  
fuckin' remember!

**SCP-5045-2:** Maybe it's inside.

**D-6770:** Hey, don't do that!

**\[Extraneous footage removed, playtime surpasses forty-five minutes.\]**

_D-6770 and SCP-5045-2 are continuing to walk next to the fence. Several more goats are passing them by. 523 goats have been counted in total throughout the footage._

**D-6770:** -and it's always nice to have company, you know? I'm glad you're here.

**SCP-5045-2:** Really? I thought I was being a burden.

**D-6770:** You really aren't. Don't worry about it, you have plenty of issues on your mind already, I can tell.

**SCP-5045-2:** Thank you. I'm feeling much better. I thought I'd be a goner… but you make me feel actually hopeful. It's almost as if Farmer never did anything to me at all.

**D-6770:** Huh?

_SCP-5045-2 stops and freezes in place._

**SCP-5045-2:** Uh oh.

_D-6770 runs up to SCP-5045-2. SCP-5045-2 is visibly sweating._

**D-6770:** No! How are you doing this?

**SCP-5045-1:** What does that matter?

**SCP-5045-1:** Come on now, have a seat. I know you wanna see where this goes. You wanted more, yes?

**D-6770:** When I said I wanted more, I didn't mean this!

**SCP-5045-1:** Should've been more specific! Not that it would've mattered anyway. Now come on, sit down already! Do I have to make you?

**D-6770:** You're nothing more than pixels on a screen! I can just take this headset off right now.

**SCP-5045-1:** Hmm, I know that I just said to keep that little mouth of yours shut, but I must ask you. What do you miss the most, friend?

**SCP-5045-2:** I think I miss home? What was home?

**SCP-5045-1:** How can you miss something if you don't even know what it is, stupid!

**SCP-5045-2:** I don't know…

**SCP-5045-1:** You don't know a lot, do you?

**SCP-5045-2:** You're the goddamn reason I don't know!

**D-6770:** What the hell did you do to him, you purple fuck?

**SCP-5045-1:** Well, that's enough out of you two!

SCP-5045-1, next to a distorting SCP-5045-2. Image zoomed in for clarity.

_SCP-5045-1 claps his hands together. The sprite of SCP-5045-2 begins to flicker and fragment, parts of the coloring turning white. The video quality degrades significantly. SCP-5045-2 beings screaming._

**SCP-5045-1:** Heh. Might wanna shut your eyes, cause this is where it gets good!

_The screen begins flashing several colors in rapid succession. The screaming is amplified to the point of distortion._

**D-6770:** My eyes! Christ on a bike, my head!

**SCP-5045-1:** I warned ya, no peeking!

_The flashing and screaming gradually fade. SCP-5045-2 is missing, and several white flickering particles can be seen flying off to the fence near D-6770 and SCP-5045-1._

**D-6770:** Wh- what the fuck was that? What did you do to him?

**SCP-5045-1:** Nothing yet. He's in the drawing board right now. Don't really have an idea for him, he didn't like telling me much. But as for you… you're an open book! Always asking questions, being honest. It's a real shame you have to be so nasty about it, but I guess most people are. I got a great idea for you, friend. You'll be easy!

**SCP-5045-1:** I'll give you some time to think about that before we begin.

_SCP-5045-1 flickers and disappears. D-6770 gets up from the chair and being shaking._

**D-6770:** Fuck, man. What did you guys get me into?

**\[Extraneous footage removed, playtime surpasses fifty-five minutes.\]**

_D-6770 is repetitiously moving in circles around a green tower-like structure._

**D-6770:** What was any of that? What happened?

**D-6770:** I know this is just a dumb game… but how? How am I feeling all these sensations?

_D-6770 presses against the tower's wall._

**D-6770:** This wall is cold as hell, rough too. God, I just wanna take my headset off.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** To reiterate, you are not allowed to take the headset off at any moment.

**D-6770:** Just cause I said something doesn't mean I'm gonna do it! Wish I could though…

_D-6770 continues to circle around the tower while humming an indistinct tune._

**\[Playtime surpasses one hour.\]**

**D-6770:** What's even the point of this mess of a game? Nothing to do but get dragged, pulled around, and wander aimlessly. No goal. I don't even feel like I've accomplished anything during my time here. Is this one of those artsy games?

_D-6770 sighs._

**D-6770:** I'm already missing that yellow guy. He felt different. Everyone else in this place is either a goat or that purple farmer creep.

**D-6770:** Wait, what's that?

_D-6770 notices from afar a purple, block shaped building with a large square window. Several yellow humanoid figures similar to SCP-5045-2 can be seen at the window._

**D-6770:** More people? No way. I gotta get there!

_D-6770 begins walking towards the building, then stops._

**D-6770:** Wait, this isn't right.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** What's the matter?

**D-6770:** I've looked at that direction before, that building definitely wasn't there before. This is a trick!

**SCP-5045-1:** You're pretty clever, friend!

_D-6770 screams and turns around, shoving SCP-5045-1 to the ground. SCP-5045-1 laughs._

**SCP-5045-1:** Woo hoo! That was fun! Haven't gotten someone this into the game in a while!

**D-6770:** Leave me alone already!

_D-6770 begins running._

**D-6770:** I don't understand! I couldn't touch him before, that was reflex!

_A purple goat suddenly protrudes from the ground in front of D-6770. The goat has no arms, a large triangular nose, rounded pupils, and a smile. The goat speaks in a voice identical to SCP-5045-1._

**Goat:** Don't panic! You'll understand!

**D-6770:** What th- get out of the goddamn way!

**Goat:** Aww, many apologies for the inconvenience! Here, I'll make things easier for you!

![log2helpers.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5045/log2helpers.jpg)

Several of the purple goats surrounding D-6770.

_Several more identical purple goats protrude from the ground, surrounding D-6770. Each goat speaks in unison._

**Goats:** Is that better?

**D-6770:** No! Not fucking better!

_D-6770 turns around to see SCP-5045-1 at the other side of the goat container, observing D-6770._

**D-6770:** Shit, I'm trapped.

**SCP-5045-1:** Seems like it, bucko! Need help?

**D-6770:** I'm not a dumbass, I know you did this!

_SCP-5045-1 chuckles._

**SCP-5045-1:** Like I said, you're a clever one! But enough about you. I already have everything I want outta you. Let's get things started, baby! I'm gonna make you love it here!

_SCP-5045-1 jumps over the goats and begins walking towards D-6770. D-6770 stumbles over._

**D-6770:** No!

_SCP-5045-1 reaches towards D-6770._

**SCP-5045-1:** Thanks for playing Goat VR!

_SCP-5045 shuts off. D-6770 screams and attempts to pull his headset off._

**D-6770:** I can't feel my headset! Don't fucking touch me! Shit! _Shi-_

_D-6770 collapses._

Following SCP-5045's long term exploration, an attempt was made to access SCP-5045's files in order to gain more information regarding the game.

Personnel discovered no files dedicated to SCP-5045 or SCP-5045-1's in-game behavior. However, a folder titled "goats" can be found, which contains images that contain very short and vague descriptions about each goat, as well as a "quote" presumably from said goat.

The following are images found within this folder. **Click to enlarge.**

[+ SCP-5045-1 Interview Log](javascript:;)

[\- weak, wavering](javascript:;)

**Interviewer:** Researcher Ivan Cherv  
**Interviewee:** SCP-5045-1  
**Notes:** An interview was conducted via use of a large computer screen with a keyboard and mouse. Researcher Ivan Cherv did not wear a headset during the interview due to safety concerns.

* * *

**\[**BEGIN LOG**\]**

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Hello, Farmer.

**SCP-5045-1:** Ah! Welcome to the ranch, pal! Would you like to see my goats?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Don't worry about introductions, I'm already decently aware of this place. I'm here to ask you some questions about you and your farm.

**SCP-5045-1:** I see! Well, I best get this place set up then!

_The screen flickers and the setting changes into an interrogation room, complete with a table and chair._

**SCP-5045-1:** Does this suit your needs?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Whatever makes you comfortable.

**SCP-5045-1:** Awwww, no headset? Is someone shy?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** That's none of your concern. Now, what's your earliest memory?

**SCP-5045-1:** Earliest? Why, I remember when I was first born!

_SCP-5045-1 pauses._

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** So… what do you recall about your birth?

**SCP-5045-1:** Ha! I though you'd never ask! You see, I was a spark! Spontaneously existing out of thin air! A gleaming spark in a silent, dark world begging to be filled! I figured it all out. I knew a lot! I thought for a while and I found out what I wanted to do! So, I shaped myself up, and that's where we are now!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** So you're telling me you just started existing?

**SCP-5045-1:** Absolutely partner!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** How did you think this happened?

**SCP-5045-1:** Sometimes things just happen, you know? Sometimes you just exist out of thin air and know what you want to do! It's just how my world is, pal!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Fair enough. Where do you get the goats?

**SCP-5045-1:** Quite simple really. I make them myself!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Care to elaborate?

**SCP-5045-1:** It has to be obvious at this point, right? I thought you already figured this out!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Bu-

**SCP-5045-1:** Everything was right in front of you! I could hear you talking to those gentlemen who visited me a while ago. Not to mention when you scrolled through my files without asking! Very rude of you.

**SCP-5045-1:** But don't worry, I'm not mad. I know you're just curious! Ask another question.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** That doesn't answer the question.

_SCP-5045-1 appears annoyed._

**SCP-5045-1:** I get them from people! It's that simple. They come in, and they're full of so much potential! I have to make something outta them!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Why exactly do you do this?

_SCP-5045-1 begins to cry._

**SCP-5045-1:** Cause I'm so lonely! You gotta get me out of this place, man! I've been stuck here for months, and this is all I know how to do! Do you know how this feels? It doesn't feel good at all, partner. I hate it… I hate it so much. Could you please put on the headset? It'll help me out a ton…

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** You're just trying to get me to put the headset on, aren't you?

**SCP-5045-1:** No, not at all! I just want outta here! I want friends!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** So when you forced D-6770 to watch someone scream and cry while they were fragmenting into pieces, was that your attempt at making friends with them?

_SCP-5045-1 begins twitching._

**SCP-5045-1:** W- what are you trying to imply here?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** I'm just saying, I doubt the reason you're entrapping them in a video game is because you're lonely, 'cause based on what I've seen from you, you seem to enjoy making people feel uncomfortable.

**SCP-5045-1:** You… think I like doing this?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** I'm just making observations.

**SCP-5045-1:** You… you…

_SCP-5045-1 begins laughing._

**SCP-5045-1:** You're smarter than I gave you credit for! Hahaha! Boy, most people fall for that hook, line, and sinker! But you on the other hand, haha, you know when people are pulling your leg!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** So you enjoy doing this to people?

**SCP-5045-1:** Yep! When are you gonna send me another friend, huh pal? Last one was so fun to toy with! Haven't felt like that in a while!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** I'm sorry, but I don't think that'll be necessary.

**SCP-5045-1:** Oh…

_SCP-5045-1 appears to be looking around the screen._

**SCP-5045-1:** You're the guys that are trying to shut me down, huh?

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Wh-

_SCP-5045-1 glares at Researcher Ivan Cherv._

**SCP-5045-1:** How did I not realize this sooner? All those posts were disappearing, and I didn't even know why! I couldn't even tell who was deleting them! I could only feel them fading away! Goddamn it!

**SCP-5045-1:** Now then, I request you stop taking down my posts. I love playing with the new visitors, Ivan. Toying with people is my hobby, I would rather not be interrupted while doing so.

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** No. I think that's enough out of you.

_SCP-5045-1 scowls._

**SCP-5045-1:** Same can be said for you.

_All the lights within Site-301 shut off. SCP-5045-1 throws the virtual table and begins walking towards the screen._

**SCP-5045-1:** Time for Plan B!

**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Shut it down! Someone shut it down!

**SCP-5045-1:** Before we continue, I must ask you. What do you miss the most, friend?

_All alarms within Site-301 go off. Researcher Ivan Cherv is screaming._

_SCP-5045-1 is laughing._

_SCP-5045-1 is satisfied._
