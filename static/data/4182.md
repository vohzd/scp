**Invalid file/directory ('CAM-5.ogg')**

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to review IntSCPFN servers for files affected by SCP-4182. These files are to be isolated and reported to the on-duty server administrator for review and sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there is no Site-5.

**Description:** SCP-4182 is a phenomenon by which internal Foundation documents are periodically altered to include references to a non-existent site ("Site-5"). The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood.

Depictions of Site-5 are inconsistent, but typically describe it as a man-made island constructed to store hazardous materials.[1](javascript:;)

Since its discovery in 2018, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been increasing exponentially.

Footnotes
