**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5090-1 is to be kept in a tidal vivarium. A Faraday cage hardwired to the Foundation intranet is to be positioned around the enclosure to restrict public access to SCP-5090 and SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C. Disinformation campaigns regarding the sites are to be launched to settle any possible sightings of SCP-5090 before Foundation intervention. SCP-5090-1 is to be fed one loggerhead turtle egg daily, and supplied a dish of saltwater, to be exchanged for fresh saltwater every two weeks.

**Description:** SCP-5090 is a Wide Area Network server. No evidence of external hardware which operates SCP-5090 exists; instead, SCP-5090 is entirely operated by SCP-5090-1. It has been concluded that SCP-5090 and SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C operate based on the daily actions of SCP-5090-1.

SCP-5090-1 is a colony of Atlantic ghost crabs (_Ocypodinae quadrata_) which previously resided on Scotch Beach, Block Island, Rhode Island (see addendum 1). SCP-5090-1 appears to be sapient; it is concluded that SCP-5090-1 collectively has the equivalent intelligence of a seven-year-old human child. SCP-5090's exact method of creation is unknown, although enough evidence has led to the conclusion that SCP-5090-1 created it through telecommunication. SCP-5090-1 will interact with users of SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C, appearing to perceive users as other animals in the area.

SCP-5090-A, SCP-5090-B, and SCP-5090-C are websites created by SCP-5090-1. One or more of these websites will appear in a user's browser history and/or bookmarks before the user had accessed these websites in the first place. Visiting SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C will automatically connect the user to SCP-5090.

SCP-5090-A is a blog-style website accessible by the domain www.turtleeggtime.crab, mainly consisting of posts about the daily lives of SCP-5090-1.

SCP-5090-B is a video sharing website accessible by the domain www.digfromdanger.crab. Despite its intended purpose, SCP-5090-B contains few videos posted by SCP-5090-1. SCP-5090-1 mainly interacts with users through the community tab, and commenting on works uploaded by other users.

SCP-5090-C is an educational webpage consisting of interactive media with the purpose of educating school age children that is accessible by the domain www.sand.crab.

**Addendum 1.1: SCP-5090-1 Interaction Pre Containment**

On 07/06/2019 Dr. Marigold and Researcher Crane accessed SCP-5090-A and SCP-5090-B to interact with SCP-5090-1 before containment. Dr. Marigold went under the alias _"Crabgirl19"_, and Researcher Crane went under the alias _"Puzzledhearts"_.

Closing statement: the animals mentioned in the log by SCP-5090-1 led to the conclusion that it resided in Rhode Island. SCP-5090-1 mentioning "block" appears to be a reference to Block Island, Rhode island.
