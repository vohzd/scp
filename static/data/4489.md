I wrote this as a rewrite of SCP-089-ARC. That article wasn't very good, so hopefully this is a little better.

SCP-4489

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4489 is contained within a low-security item locker at Site-81. Access to SCP-4489 is to be granted only with permission from the Site-81 research authority.

**Description:** SCP-4489 is a small, carved wooden statue of a cartoon hobo. Individuals exposed to SCP-4489 in close proximity will gradually begin to express feelings of guilt, often as a result of minor or non-existent slights they feel that they have somehow inflicted on those around them. Prolonged exposure to SCP-4489 often leads to such inflated feelings of guilt and regret that the subject becomes inconsolable or otherwise impossible to interact with until SCP-4489 is removed.

Subjects typically return to a baseline behavior after SCP-4489 has been removed, time depending on the length of time exposed.

**Addendum 4489.1:** Testing Log

_For testing purposes, SCP-4489 was set on a table in the center of a standard testing chamber. Subjects were then exposed to SCP-4489 in various scenarios and for various lengths of time._

**TEST AUDIO RECORDING TRANSCRIPT**

_D-91101 and D-84544 enter containment chamber. After a few moments, SCP-4489 is brought into the chamber and sat on a table._

**D-91101:** So what now? We just sit here?

**Dr. Brannaugh:** Yep. You just sit there.

**D-84544:** Got it.

_Eight seconds pass._

**D-84544:** Hey, buddy.

**D-91101:** Yeah guy?

**D-84544:** Look, I just wanted to apologize for getting all up in your space right now. I shouldn't be doing that.

_Note: D-84544 and D-91101 are currently more than 3m apart._

**D-91101:** Oh, God, you don't need to apologize to me, man. I'm sorry for making you feel like you were in my space. You're not in my space; if anything, I'm in _your_ space.

**D-84544:** No, oh man, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you didn't know what your space was, or whether I was in it, honestly. I hope you can forgive me, please.

**D-91101:** (_Tears begin to form in the subject's eyes_) Oh no, I can't believe I've done this to you. I can't believe I put you in a position where you felt like you needed to apologize to me for an implication that I misread. I'm so sorry pal, I didn't mean to hurt you this way. I'll get out of your space now.

_D-91101 moves to the corner of the containment cell. D-84544 bursts into tears and collapses to the ground._

**D-84544:** (_Through tears_) No- I- I'm so- I'm so sorry you- you felt like- like you had to walk all that way just- just to satisfy my- my- my unreasonable space needs- I'm sorry- (_sniff_) Please for- forgive me. (_Weeps openly_)

**D-91101:** No! I'm sorry for what I've done to you! It was my actions that reduced you to this! I am to blame! I'm sorry!

**D-84544:** (_Crawling to the opposite corner of the room_) Wh-what? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over- over the sound of- of- of my own distracting- sobbing.

**D-91101:** (_Shouting and weeping_) OH GOD PLEASE NO WHY DO I DO THIS TO PEOPLE, I'M SO SORRY FOR INCONVENIENCING YOU LIKE THIS BY NOT PROPERLY ARTICULATING. I'M SO SORRY.

**D-84544:** I'm- I'm sorry my- my ears are so- so- (_sobs_) so dysfunctional.

**D-91101:** I'M SORRY MY INADEQUACIES HAVE PUT THIS EAR DOUBT UPON YOU, YOUR EARS ARE FINE AND I AM AT FAULT FOR BEING SUCH AN OBNOXIOUS, INARTICULATE BUFFOON.

**D-84544:** It- it- it was my hideous visage that- that did this to you, please- (_turns to face into the corner_) please let me sp- spare you my horrible face. I'm s-s-sorry I am so hideous.

**D-91101:** PLEASE, PLEASE LET ME APOLOGIZE FOR SHOULDERING YOU WITH THIS INSURMOUNTABLE AND MISPLACED SELF-DOUBT. I AM THE ONE WITH THE HIDEOUS FACE. (_Turns to face corner_) PLEASE FORGIVE ME, MY SOUL CANNOT HANDLE THIS GREAT REGRET I FEEL FOR HARMING YOU IN THIS WAY.

**D-84544:** My entire life exists only to- to- to be a mockery of a just existence. (_Inconsolable sobbing_)

_After an additional two minutes of D-84544 and D-91101 screaming apologies into the corners of the testing chamber, both subjects are removed and SCP-4489 is returned to storage._
