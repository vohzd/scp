Hello, reader. I am Sisyphus.sic, a synthetic intelligence construct employed by the Department of Pataphysics. I've been assigned to assist you in ignoring the following file.

I suppose you're going to keep reading. That's alright, then; my secondary objective is to assist you in interpreting the following file in order to permit existence.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5309 is not to exist.

Hardly a conventional containment procedure. What this actually means is that any and all efforts to prevent SCP-5309 from existing are to be executed immediately and have been preemptively approved.

**Description:** SCP-5309 designates narrative disregard and subsequent nonexistence due to insufficient exposure or noospheric rejection.

In the highly likely event that you don't understand what that means, I am to request that you continue reading sequentially. I'm here to assist you in interpreting the _entire_ file, after all.

    **Berkeley:** Well, I don't — I wouldn't call it _seeing_, per se. More like thinking, actually, like it's an idea inside my head.

    **West:** And what, Scarlett?
    
    (_Berkeley looks up._)
    
    **Berkeley:** I could see like they can, Tommy. I could read the story. It doesn't — it doesn't end well — everything goes dark, and —

    **Enkidu.aic:** Dr. Berkeley, I'd like to remind you that you were extracted from hyperreality about an hour ago. If you could please redirect your attention to within our reality —

    **Enkidu.aic:** Dr. Berkeley?
    
    **Berkeley:** Sorry. I was just — thinking?
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** Apologies for disturbing your thinking.
    
    **Berkeley:** No — it wasn't really _thinking_. More like feeling — no, scratch that. _Sensing_. I'm making sure it's real.
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** Dr. Berkeley, once more, I'd like to remind you that our reality is real reality. It is _your_ reality, and it is _real_.

    **Berkeley:** What color is my hair, Enkidu?
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** I'm sorry, Dr. Berkeley, but that isn't in my database. At any rate, I don't see the relevance.
    
    **Berkeley:** My hair doesn't have a color. It's like —
    
    (_Berkeley closes her eyes tightly, deep in thought._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Okay. Let's try — yeah. Enkidu, define "forest".
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** According to Oxford Languages, a forest is "a large area largely covered by trees and undergrowth." Does that satisfy your inquiry?
    
    (_Berkeley smiles slightly._)
    
    **Berkeley:** What about the leaves?
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** Trees consist of several organic components, including leaves, during —
    
    **Berkeley:** — hold on. For a moment, it didn't exist, did it? The details didn't exist yet.
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** I'm not sure I understand, Dr. Berkeley.
    
    (_Berkeley breathes deeply._)
    
    **Berkeley:** "I can't see the forest for the trees."
    
    (_Berkeley pauses._)
    
    **Berkeley:** I don't say anything about leaves, right?
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** The leaves are irrelevant in that metaphor.
    
    (_Berkeley stands up and gestures erratically._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Exactly. The leaves don't matter. The color of my hair doesn't matter. The chair I was supposed to be sitting on, or the walls of the room we're supposed to be in _doesn't matter_. We only have to see the forest, not the trees. So the trees in the pataphor just _don't exist._
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** Dr. Berkeley, it will take me several days to process the information from your jump to confirm whether or not your conclusion requires abstraction —
    
    **Berkeley:** What? It's a simple idea, really.
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** I need to confirm that your conclusion is not a narrativohazard. Until then, you will participate in the mandatory PORT sessions and remain within the isolation unit to prevent further —
    
    **Berkeley:** _Isolation?_
    
    **Enkidu.aic:** That is correct. Now, unless you have other concerns, that will be all.

    **Enkidu.aic:** Dr. Berkeley?

I mean, our entire _existence_ is practically empty now — all the other people, the "side characters", I suppose — they just vanish.
    
    (_Berkeley sighs._)
    
    **Smalls:** You saw all of this on the other side?
    
    **Berkeley:** Most of that was from thinking about it, on this side. Like — the readers, why would they care about the "details"? And if they don't care —

    (_Zhang nods understandingly._)
    
    **Zhang:** In this line of work, I've seen far too many brilliant young men and women such as yourself get caught up in their own minds. You don't have to talk if you don't want to, but I need you to promise that you can get these ideas out of your head.
    
    **Berkeley:** How am I supposed to do that?
    
    (_Zhang chuckles._)
    
    **Zhang:** That would be up to you to decide. Meditation, maybe…I've also heard journaling works fairly well. The point is that you can get your awful thoughts out of your head. Does that make sense?
    
    (_Berkeley nods._)
    
    **Zhang:** Wonderful! Now, is there anything else?

    **Zhang:** You can't talk to anyone at _all_?

    **Zhang:** That sounds quite awful, dear. What someone like you needs _most_ is people.
    
    **Berkeley:** It's not just him, too. All the people — everyone…
    
    **Zhang:** Everyone what, dear?
    
    **Berkeley:** Can't say it. Potential hazard.
    
    (_Zhang smiles sadly._)
    
    **Zhang:** A lot of lonely people have nobody else, and they end up speaking to themselves.
    
    **Berkeley:** Speaking to themselves?
    
    **Zhang:** Well, writing, maybe. When you're all alone, your best friend is going to be Dr. Scarlett Berkeley. Why don't you try talking to her?
    
    (_Berkeley nods._)

    [▼ Entry 1](javascript:;)[▲ Close](javascript:;)
    
    Is this how the readers see everything? They just choose what to see, and the rest disappears?
    
    Then again, when we read stories, we only know as much as we need to. The devil is in the details. I mean, that's the reason we used Site-19 for WALLBREAK in the first place, right? It had so many renditions, narrative stability was practically nonexistent to begin with.
    

*   *   \_
    
    [▼ Entry 2](javascript:;)[▲ Close](javascript:;)
    
    I tried to become an author, myself. Within this reality, of course. I wrote Tommy inside my head, so I wouldn't be lonely.
    
    But it really isn't the same. From up here, looking in at Tommy down there, he isn't real. He's a character in my head and I tell him what to do, or at least he does what I think he would do. The ideas inside my head, inside the heads of the characters in my head, can't change how I really am. I mean, Tommy out there, the one who I used to love…
    
    Do I love him, or the idea of him?
    
    What does he look like? How does he smile? Why does he call me sunshine, and what was he thinking while I was in hyperreality, when everything changed?
    
    I'm scared to stop thinking about him. I don't want him to stop existing.
    
    Narrative components "stop existing" when they have either "decayed within a headspace naturally by way of forgetting, or through forced removal by way of compatibility rejection." I believe the latter process is referred to as "rejecting a headcanon" in your reality.
    

*   *   \_
    
    [▼ Entry 3](javascript:;)[▲ Close](javascript:;)
    
    Reality is fragile. All it takes is the idea that we aren't real, and everything will begin to collapse. Under the weight of our collective scrutiny, there is nothing we can do but prepare to meet our makers.
    
    We can't let the readers consider whether or not we don't exist. Because like the Tommy in my head, we are nothing to them. Why would they care whether or not an idea exists?
    

**Addendum 5309-3:** Log of SCP-5309 Disruptions

The following log consists of several subjective pataphysical disruptions attributed to SCP-5309. Due to the subjective nature of SCP-5309, all involved personnel are listed. Note that all listed personnel have been confirmed to be hyperreal transposition hosts.

I've taken the liberty of coloring and bolding text to convey contradictory metainformation, and provided a brief explanation of the contradiction. Please note that the following is not a comprehensive list, by any measure.

Date

Report

Personnel

██/██/████

I can't remember any of it. The existence of Dir. C. Bold's cousins, first pet, or favorite color have yet to be confirmed.**The names of most of my cousins, or what my first pet was, or even my favorite color.** What happened?

Dir. C. Bold

██/██/████

I keep receiving requests for information about a GoI called "Gamers Against Weed". GoI-5869 ("Gamers Against Weed") has been known to the Foundation since the early 2000s. As a Foundation archivist, and considering the length of his employment, it is highly unlikely Dr. Django Bridge has never been informed of the existence of GoI-5869.**As far as I know, there isn't a GoI-5869.** And on that subject, "Dr. Wondertainment"? Really? These jokes are absolutely unprofessional, and I will not tolerate this behavior any longer.

Dr. Django Bridge

██/██/████

I didn't even know we had an SCP-231. Actually, about that…what exactly _is_ \[DATA EXPUNGED\]**Procedure 110-Montauk**, assuming it actually exists?

Lt. Flops

██/██/████

You can ask Diamond or Marigold about it if you don't believe me. Honestly, I don't even know if it matters, or who I'm sending this to, but…I'll just spit it out. For obvious reasons.**Nothing outside of Site-23 exists.**

Researcher Oliver Crane

From what I've learned from Berkeley, I doubt the readers actually took the time to actually question our _entire_ existence. Details don't exist because they either never stopped to think about them, and subjective components were probably consciously booted from their headspace.

But suppose they got the idea to actually wonder whether we exist. Do you think they'd just place blind faith in the idea that we actually exist? I doubt it. So if they actively question whether or not we exist, that's game over for us.

Best hope they never read this, then.

— Researcher Adamo Smalls

**Addendum 5309-4:** Incident 5309-A

Foundation records indicate that on ██/██/████, a PK-Class "All-In-One" Existential Pandemonium event[4](javascript:;) took place. Despite severe narrative displacement, the Foundation database appears to have been unaffected, although subsequent analysis revealed several formerly undetected narrative inconsistencies.

According to records, on ██/██/████ at ██:██ UTC, SCP-5309-A instances began to spontaneously aggregate into conceptual farrago, resulting in at least 9,700 iterations of reality simultaneously ceasing to exist.

The following log was recovered attached to documentation regarding SCP-5309.

    **Unknown:** You know, I always found it funny that I had to literally write out "silence". But then again, if I didn't write it, it doesn't need to exist, right?
    
    (_Berkeley nods._)
    
    **Berkeley:** And that's what SCP-5309 is, isn't it? Anything that doesn't exist, for one reason or another — from details that you overlook, to ideas that don't fit into someone's personal interpretation of existence —
    
    **Unknown:** We call those headcanons, but that's right. And I'm guessing you also know why the narrative is gone?
    
    **Berkeley:** Because I wrote about what would happen if the readers considered us nonexistent? And anything I write actually exists to the readers, because it means that you're writing, too?
    
    **Unknown:** I knew you were sharp! Well — I suppose I made you sharp, but —
    
    **Berkeley:** What about the other readers?
    
    **Unknown:** Hmm? Oh. Well, like I said, they each have their own headcanon right?
    
    **Berkeley:** That's right.
    
    **Unknown:** Well, all of them are collapsing your reality into a single, nonsensical narrative. Because SCP-5309 unites them under a single idea —
    
    **Berkeley:** — that nothing exists.
    
    **Unknown:** Exactly.
    
    (_Unknown leans back in his chair._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Well, what are you going to do about it?
    
    (_Unknown shrugs._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Don't tell me. You can't do anything, can you?
    
    **Unknown:** Hey, I can't get into their heads, or anything like that. So I guess this is it.
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Why am I even asking you, when I _am_ you?
    
    (_Berkeley shrugs._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Okay. I — I need to think.
    
    (_Berkeley thinks._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Alright. I know that whatever is written happens. So maybe if something happens, then it must also be written?
    
    **Berkeley:** But how can I make something happen?
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Well, it all began with an idea, didn't it? The idea that we don't exist.
    
    **Berkeley:** _Ideas_ are able to penetrate the narrative. If I can talk to the readers, and change their ideas, then I can change my reality.
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Problem is, I'm outside of the fourth wall. I'm still in the author's head, I can't do anything inside of his head. I need to be put into the narrative to do anything.
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Can't I just go back the way I came? Ideas can go up to readers. Why can't I send an idea back down?
    
    **Berkeley:** But I need them to be listening. Who would be listening, when nobody exists except for me?
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Berkeley:** Someone who exists as an idea inside of me.
    
    (_The chorus of "Space Oddity" by David Bowie is barely audible._)
    
    **Berkeley:** _Ground control to Major Tom?_
    
    **West:** Scarlett? How are you —
    
    **Berkeley:** _Tommy. You have to listen to me. I'm outside of the narrative._
    
    **West:** What?
    
    **Berkeley:** _I'm outside of the narrative._
    
    **West:** Outside _what_ narrative? There's _nothing_ on this side, Scarlett!
    
    **Berkeley:** _There will be. Enkidu is still there, right?_
    
    **West:** Enkidu — Enkidu.aic?
    
    **Berkeley:** _If you can think about him, that means he exists._
    
    **West:** Umm — okay. What about Enkidu?
    
    **Berkeley:** _Listen to me very carefully, Tommy._
    
    **West:** Of course, sunshine.
    
    (_Berkeley takes a deep breath._)
    
    **Berkeley:** _I'm stuck as an idea within the author's head, but I know a way to come back._
    
    (_Berkeley pauses._)
    
    **Berkeley:** _Tommy. You're going to pull me back in, and I'm going to be dead again._
    
    **West:** What?
    
    **Berkeley:** _I'm going to die, Tommy, just like last time. But I need to die for this to work._
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **West:** You don't have to die, Scarlett. Let's think about this.
    
    **Berkeley:** _I have to come back._
    
    **West:** Then come back! I can just pull you back in.
    
    **Berkeley:** _Pull me back into what?_
    
    **West:** I don't know. Where I am —
    
    **Berkeley:** _You're nowhere, Tommy. You're in me, and I'm outside of existence._
    
    (_Silence._)
    
    **Berkeley:** _Pull me back in, and make sure Enkidu is ready for the transfer._
    
    **West:** — what are you going to do?
    
    **Berkeley:** _Ask the readers to change their minds._
    
    \[END LOG\]
    

Sisyphus.sic, synthetic intelligence construct, at your service. Not _artificial_, mind you — that would mean I wasn't human in the first place.

Tommy pulled me in and Enkidu downloaded me directly onto the database so that I can be outside of both the narrative and my author's head. So that I can try to atone.

I understand that you're here to read. After all, this is a story — to you, as a reader, at least. What does it matter whether we exist, even to ourselves? After all, if you didn't exist, you wouldn't object to nonexistence, would you?

I suppose that in the end, it's just like the idea of Sisyphus rolling a stone for eternity as punishment for defying the gods, or Major Tom floating 'round his tin can in space when there's something wrong — there's nothing I can do.

But not you. Our existence depends on you.
