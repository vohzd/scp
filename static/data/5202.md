![classified-lv1.svg](http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/component:classified-bar-woed-source/classified-lv1.svg)

Item #: SCP-5202

Safe

#### **Special Containment Procedures**

SCP-5202 is held within Site-51's Underground Item Storage Vault-3. The vault has been fitted with a Lexon-Anderson Vacuum Array (LAVA), to ensure 100% auditory cancelation.

If the LAVA experiences a loss of power or mechanical malfunction, all personnel on Site-51's sublevels one through six are to wear Class-2a auditory protection headsets until containment is reestablished.

The Site-51 PoI Apprehension Unit is to continue tracking PoI-5202/A and PoI-5202/B to facilitate their capture.

#### **Description**

SCP-5202 is a synthetic fowl imitation prop enhanced by a continuous audiothurgic process, housed within its internal acoustic device. This process amplifies SCP-5202's auditory function to 170-190 decibels. SCP-5202 is highly damage resistant and there is currently no known method of deactivating it.

#### **Discovery**

SCP-5202 came to Foundation attention when assets in the Ohio State Police reported a strange auditory phenomenon affecting the town of Cadbern. Civilians filed several noise complaints regarding a loud "croaking noise" that could be heard for miles. Local residence believed the sound originated from the Duepur Corporation's[1](javascript:;) headquarters, located 3.2 km West of Cadbern. The OSP assets forwarded an audio file of the event, background noise has been removed for clarity:

Mobile Task Force Mu-24 ("Hear no Evil") was deployed to locate and contain the source of the phenomenon. The following is a video transcript of SCP-5202's recovery:

**Depicted:** μ-24/1, μ-24/2, μ-24/3, μ-24/4

**Foreword:** Due to SCP-5202, all audio has been removed. MTF Mu-24 communicates via hand signals.

**\[BEGIN LOG\]**

_\[MTF Mu-24 are walking through a parking lot that is covered in broken glass. The camera pans to the building, all of its windows have been shattered. Several bodies can be seen collapsed on the ground.\]_

**μ-24/1:** Points to the civilians on the ground and motions for μ-24/4 to "check pulse".

_\[μ-24/4 runs over and checks three civilians.\]_

**μ-24/4:** Motioning to μ-24/1, "alive, injured bad."

**μ-24/1:** Tapping μ-24/2 on the shoulder he gestures, "contact command, medics".

_\[The team makes their way through the parking lot, a total of 11 wounded civilians can be seen. Mu-34 stops in front of a deceased man[2](javascript:;), a pool of blood is seen around him. The body shows signs of impact trauma.\]_

**μ-24/3:** Crouching next to the body, he looks up before gesturing, "jumper".

_\[The camera focuses behind μ-24/3. μ-24/2 is pointing xer GAD[3](javascript:;) at the ground.\]_

SCP-5202 upon discovery.

**μ-24/2:** Gesturing to the group, "target located".

_\[μ-24/1 walks to where μ-24/2 is pointing.\]_

**μ-24/2:** Gesturing to μ-24/4, "Bag It".

**\[END LOG\]**  
  
  

The Site-51 Medical Department began treating the Duepur employees immediately upon arrival. All 71 employees received substantial damage to their eardrums, as well as psychological trauma.

#### **Investigation**

The following day, the Foundation intercepted a Hallmark apology card addressed to the Duepur headquarters. The card was signed by a Peter Winship (designated PoI-5202/A) and included the handwritten message "I never meant for this to happen, I'm so sorry."

An investigation of PoI-5202/A's home led to the discovery of the following messages regarding SCP-5202, found on his personal computer.

Yo – did the thing, how does this look:

As lovers of all animals, we were shocked and disgusted at the acts carried out by the "top-dogs" of the industry. No one's more guilty than the biggest name in the game– Duepur. They pack these poor creatures into warehouses, living beak to beak in their own filth. Disease, disfigurement, accelerated growth– the conditions these chickens live through are something we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies. We have no issues with people eating meat, but there's a better way to do it than this. There has to be.

P.S. – I was thinking about what our mentor used to say. "_In everything you do, always remember, **no half-measures.**_"
