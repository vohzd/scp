**Item #:** SCP-5588

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents imbedded in various space agencies are to remove all information concerning SCP-5588 from their systems. In the event that an SCP-5588 seed is on a collision course with the sun, various Foundation rockets are to intercept and redirect it.

**Description:** SCP-5588 is a species of interstellar megaflora that inhabits galaxies inside the Virgo Supercluster. SCP-5588 instances superficially resemble trees, but are comprised of several types of organic metals, various biological machinery, and unknown transdimensional interlocking organics.

SCP-5588 seeds are massive, roughly twice the size of Earth, and contain a core filled with methane and various other gasses. The seeds use these gasses as a rudimentary propulsion system in order to navigate to a targeted star. SCP-5588 instances primarily target stars that are near the beginning of their life, and are at between 10-20 solar masses.

Once an SCP-5588 seed locates a suitable star it will steer itself to impact that star at one of its poles, in order to avoid interference from the star's magnetic field. Over the next 3-5 thousand years the seed will begin to grow roots into the star, locking itself in place. These roots contain various biomechanical components that slowly leech hydrogen and oxygen out of the star, which the plant internally fuses into H2O in order to facilitate its growth. Once the SCP-5588 instance has a strong hold on the star it will proceed to the next phase, and will begin to grow upward.

Over the next 5-7 million years, the instance will spread out, and begin to grow around the star, following its magnetic field. This process continues until the star has been completely enveloped. At this point the growth of the plant speeds up tremendously, growing increasingly denser around the star in order to absorb 100% of the star's energy output.

Once this growth is completed, the SCP-5588 instance will begin to drain resources from the star rapidly. Lacking the materials required to undergo fusion, the star will begin to die at a significantly accelerated rate, often over sixty thousand times as quickly as it would otherwise. At this point the plant will begin to grow several small holes in the exterior, into which they deposit seeds. Once these seeds have all been placed the plant will begin to use its roots to crush the star, forcing it to undergo a supernova. The seeds then use the explosive force in order to propel themselves towards nearby stars, at which point the cycle restarts.

If the original plant survives the explosion it will reseal itself closed around the newly formed neutron star, and will continue to harvest energy from it and grow outward until either it or the star dies. On rare occasions, the plant will shed large amounts of matter into the neutron star, which will cause it to undergo a secondary explosion, allowing the plant to release a second wave of seeds, and then collapse into a black hole. The plant will continue to encircle the resulting black hole until it presumably dies and collapses into the singularity.

**Addendum 5588-1:**

SCP-5588 instances contain a small extradimensional component. This component is typically inert, but has been seen to activate occasionally. To date, the only SCP-5588 instances to activate this component have been ones that have undergone a secondary explosion and are in orbit around black holes. Once activated, these plants (designated SCP-5588-1) spontaneously generated an internal wormhole inside the singularity. All of these wormholes exit at roughly the same location approximately 247 billion light years away from earth, over 150 billion light years beyond the edge of the observable universe. The purpose of these wormholes is unknown. Foundation scans of the area reveal a single root, significantly larger than any other SCP-5588 instances or the galaxies that contain them. The area around this root contains a hyper dense amount of dark energy, which the root continually excretes.
