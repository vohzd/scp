SCP-527.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-527 is to be contained within a standard humanoid domicile at Site-19. No other containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-527 is a male humanoid, 1.67m in height, which is biologically non-anomalous, with the exception of its head, which is that of a _Puntius semifasciolatus_, or gold barb fish.

SCP-527 displays no other anomalous qualities. The head of SCP-527 functions the same as the head of any other non-anomalous human. SCP-527 is capable of typical human speech. A tattoo reading "Mr. Fish, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment" appears on the bottom of its left foot.

**Discovery:** SCP-527 was discovered in Boston by Foundation agents in 2002, and was moved to Site-19 in 2004.

**Addendum 527.1:** Initial Interview

\[BEGIN LOG\]

**Dr. Baker:** Thank you for your cooperation thus far, SCP-527. We're just using this interview as a way to gauge any potential anomalous behavior we might not expect.

**SCP-527:** Alright.

**Dr. Baker:** To begin, are you capable of breathing underwater?

**SCP-527:** No.

**Dr. Baker:** Are you capable of communicating with other fish, or with other sea-based lifeforms?

**SCP-527:** No.

**Dr. Baker:** I see. When did you first discover your condition? Were you by any chance attacked or bitten by a fish you did not recognize, or experience an encounter with a sea-based deity of some kind?

**SCP-527:** No.

**Dr. Baker:** Uh… well, then you've been like this since birth?

**SCP-527:** Yep.

**Dr. Baker:** I… alright. Do you know of any other anomalous traits you might exhibit?

**SCP-527:** Sure don't. Like I told the other guy, this is all it is. You're looking at it. Lie, Stripes, Hot, Sweetie, they got all the good stuff. I'm just the guy with a fish head.

**Dr. Baker:** Do you… have any idea why your creator might have fashioned you in this… way?

**SCP-527:** Fuck if I know.
