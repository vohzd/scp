**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5265 is to be contained within a standard humanoid cell. Stimulation, such as books, paper, and a pencil, is to be provided on a regular basis. No sustenance is necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5265 is a disembodied arm of an adult male. Despite a large wound where the arm would have been affixed to its original body, as well as signs of decomposition and arthritis, it shows no hindrance in actions. It is clothed in an Indian Army uniform, dating back to the early 1940s. Genetic testing to determine the owner of SCP-5265 has proven inconclusive.

SCP-5265 is capable of limited movement. By repeatedly locking and unlocking itself in positions and grasping surfaces with its nails, it can produce a vaguely inchworm-like style of locomotion. Additionally, SCP-5265 is capable of challenging manual tasks, such as threading a needle or flipping a glass, despite lacking ocular organs or a neural center.

SCP-5265 has displayed signs of sapience, writing in a dated form of British English to communicate when given a pen. However, SCP-5265 is incapable of understanding attempts to communicate with it, presumably from a lack of expertise in Braille.

Attached are assorted communications from SCP-5265.

> Khalistan.[1](javascript:;)

> 
> I should not have trusted him.

> They told me that if I died, I would see God.  
> I have not seen him. Everything is terrible.  
> Their God takes care of all His children. I should have remembered 20 missionaries who told us that before.

**Note:** On production of the last note, SCP-5265 produced a fully-loaded Lee Enfield No.1 Mk.III rifle from its pocket. The origin of this weapon is currently unknown - checks in SCP-5265's pockets previously yielded no thaumaturgical traces or spatial anomalies. SCP-5265 proceeded to grasp the rifle, and fired it at the nearest window. Recoil from the rifle caused it to jump backwards and sever SCP-5265 at the wrist. Immediately, the flesh of the detached arm section decomposed into a black, putrid sludge, leaving only bone. The hand section worked the bolt and fired again, dislocating and severing SCP-5265's lower portion of its hand and thumb with the rifle's bayonet, leaving a thin section of flesh and four fingers. Severed sections decomposed again. The remaining section ceased firing, instead retrieving a piece of paper and proceeding to write the following note.

> I will continue.  
> There is no other option I have.  
> I do not want to die. I do not want to live like this.  
> So what will I do?  
> There is no crying. There is no time for depression.  
> _I must continue._
