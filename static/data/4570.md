SCP-4570

**Special Containment Procedures:** A 3.6-meter tall steel fence has been built around SCP-4570. This fence is to be patrolled by Foundation officials under the guise of SCP-4570 being a historic landmark. Personnel are to incapacitate any wildlife near SCP-4570 and relocate them a safe distance away. Individuals attempting to enter SCP-4570 are to be administered Class-A amnestics and released. Existing SCP-4570-A instances are to be monitored for possible containment breaches.

Further investigations into the source of SCP-4570’s anomalous properties are currently ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-4570 is the town of Nelson, Nevada, abandoned in 1971. Buildings within SCP-4570 are in a state of severe disrepair, with many having completely collapsed. All organisms that enter SCP-4570 will experience rapid genetic transformations. SCP-4570's effect culminates with the affected subject becoming a plant or animal native to the state of West Virginia. This effect extends to both flora and fauna, with resulting transformations (referred to as SCP-4570-A) having similar genetics and physical traits to the original entity. During these transformations, subjects have expressed extreme distress and discomfort.

Humans that enter SCP-4570 will be subject to SCP-4570’s transformation effect, although no exact pattern has been found between resulting SCP-4570-A instances.[1](javascript:;) The only consistent effect between experiments has been reports of faint music before transformations take place, with most likening it to a song in a country genre. Recorded SCP-4570-A instances resulting from humans include:

*   North American porcupines (_Erethizon dorsatum_)
*   Willow oaks (_Quercus phellos_)
*   American black bears (_Ursus americanus_)
*   Turkey vultures (_Cathartes aura_)
*   Common snapping turtles (_Chelydra serpentina_)
*   Blueberries (_Vaccinium corymbosum_)

SCP-4570-A instances capable of locomotion will enter a building within SCP-4570. Once inside, SCP-4570-A will take on the job of a human working in that building. Despite the physical limitations of many SCP-4570-A, these jobs will be executed at a level equal to that of a human. Once their job is completed, instances will enter other buildings and socialize with other SCP-4570-A. There are currently 129 recorded SCP-4570-A instances, with 47 of the town's buildings being completely occupied. SCP-4570-A have shown notable hostility towards the Foundation, actively destroying remote drones and other monitoring devices.

Several meteorological anomalies are present within SCP-4570, with the measured air pressure of the town being significantly higher than the surrounding area. In addition, several incidents of SCP-4570 experiencing significantly colder weather than the surrounding area have been recorded.

**Addendum:** On 10/12/1997, all activity within SCP-4570 suddenly ceased for approximately 22 hours, including its transformative and meteorological properties. During this 22 hour period, Agent Claudia Amherst was dispatched to investigate. Included below is a transcript of the exploration.

**Exploration log - SCP-4570 - 10/12/1997**

**Date:** 10/12/97

**Exploration Team:** Agent Claudia Amherst

**Subject:** SCP-4570

* * *

\[BEGIN LOG\]

**Amherst:** Check, check, do you hear me?

**Command:** Loud and clear. Search the town for any signs of the anomaly.

**Amherst:** Understood. (_Pause_) Any word on the dash A’s activity? I’d rather not get mauled by a bobcat today.

**Command:** Negative. Locate them, if possible.

**Amherst:** (_Sigh_) Alright.

(_Amherst begins to navigate towards the center of SCP-4570._)

**Amherst:** There’s a building over here that looks fairly intact. It looks like some sort of store, but the sign on the front is too faded to make out.

(_Amherst draws her firearm and enters the building. Visible in the building are several store shelves in various states of disrepair. A wooden counter is visible in the background._)

**Amherst:** Is this coming through clearly Command?

**Command:** All clear.

**Amherst:** God, it smells horrible in here. I think it’s this food on the shelves, at least I think it’s food. Most of these are just empty boxes and tin cans.

**Amherst:** I think I’ve found a dash A. There’s a groundhog holding one of the tin cans just sitting on the shelf, looking at me.

**Command:** Has it noticed you?

**Amherst:** (_Pause_) I don’t think it can notice me. It’s not moving at all, not even breathing. It looks like one of the taxidermy animals my uncle had all around his cabin.

(_Amherst holsters her weapon before taking a tin can off the nearby shelf and lightly throwing it near the SCP-4570-A instance. The can impacts the shelf the instance is sitting on before falling to the ground. No reaction is observed. Amherst approaches the instance._)

**Command:** Collect the instance for examination.

**Amherst:** Understood.

(_Amherst places the instance under her arm before walking towards the wooden counter._)

**Amherst:** Hey Command, do you see this?

**Command:** Please elaborate.

**Amherst:** There’s a tree growing right in front of the cash register. It’s not growing through the floor either, it’s somehow growing on top of the floor.

**Command:** Noted. Collect a sample from the tree and continue on.

**Amherst:** Copy.

(_Amherst breaks a low hanging branch from the tree and places it in her pack. She then exits the store and continues through SCP-4570._)

**Amherst:** There’s a lot of collapsed buildings here. Any word on why it was abandoned?

**Command:** It is assumed to be related to the anomaly, although no clear reason for the disappearances has been found.

**Amherst:** Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Looks like there’s another store up ahead. The sign says something about guns, but the rest of it is unreadable. I’m heading in. (_Pause_) Oh fuck!

**Command:** Amherst, what happened?

**Amherst:** It (_Pause_) it looks like the floor of the building collapsed into a basement of sorts. I didn’t see it at first and almost fell straight in.

**Command:** Are you injured?

**Amherst:** No, I’m fine, just a bit shaken. On a positive note, I’ve found where all of our drones have gone.

(_Amherst leans into the doorway of the store. In the hole is a large pile of shattered wood covered with various mechanical parts._)

**Command:** Understood. Continue on to the next building.

(_Amherst leaves the building and proceeds to a nearby building._)

**Amherst:** Looks like we’ve got a bar here. It seems to be in better condition than the rest of the town too. The sign on the wall here says “Johnny’s Saloon.”

(_Amherst enters the building._)

**Amherst:** (_Pause_) Command, something isn’t right here.

**Command:** Can you elaborate?

**Amherst:** This building looks like it’s been completely untouched. No broken furniture, no shattered bottles, nothing.

**Amherst:** There’s even a jukebox against the wall here. A Wurlitzer 1050, like the one back at the Site-17 break room. (_Pause_) It’s still on?

**Command:** Repeat?

**Amherst:** The lights on the machine are still on. The glass isn’t even dusty. (_Pause_) Looks like there’s only one record inside, but I can’t read the label from here.

**Command:** Are there any markings on the machine?

**Amherst:** Not that I can see. (_Pause_) Hold on, there’s some writing on the side. “We all deserve to belong. My only hope is to bring you closer to heaven, one lyric at a time.”

**Command:** Acknowledged.

**Amherst:** Request to return to base before I’m turned into a copperhead.

**Command:** Granted.
