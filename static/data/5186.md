Border of SCP-5186's area of effect

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area containing SCP-5186 is to be routinely patrolled by Foundation naval vessels. Any unauthorised vessels approaching the area are to be redirected and provided with the cover story that the space is part of a long-term conservation effort.

All Foundation crew members involved with containment are to routinely report in with medical staff to assess for potential exposure to SCP-5186. Should a crew mate express any distinct symptoms[1](javascript:;), medical staff are authorised to administer amnestics across all potentially affected crew.

In the event that a patrolling Foundation vessel drifts into SCP-5186's range, all involved personnel should initiate the Blindside Protocol with immediate effect. Under no circumstances should a vessel open fire at any perceived entity without sonar confirmation from Site-39.

**Description:** SCP-5186 is a behavioural phenomenon linked to a 50km diameter area of open water off the coast of Chile. Any individuals entering SCP-5186's space will initially experience mild discomfort, often complaining about feelings of nausea and restlessness. Further travel into the area will inevitably cause subjects to believe they are being watched by an entity in the water.

Affected individuals are unable to physically see the entity, and all attempts to locate one with sonar equipment have so far failed. Regardless, subjects will eventually conclude whatever is watching them is large enough to completely devour both themselves and any vessel they may be situated on. This effect remains consistent regardless of vessel size. A person's belief that the entity watching them is real will only become stronger as they move further in.

Examination of an affected subject's brain activity shows heightened stimulation of the amygdala[2](javascript:;). This effect is consistent across all subjects, and suggests a natural 'fight-or-flight' response specific to SCP-5186. Depending on the subject's mental state and the distance travelled into SCP-5186's area, this fear response[3](javascript:;) can induce severe anxiety, dread, and depression.

[![Chimera](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5186/Chimera/medium.jpg)](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5186/Chimera)

Deployment of _Chimera_ from Site-39.

**Discovery:** SCP-5186 was initially brought to the Foundation's attention in 1987 following the loss of a Columbian research vessel. The missing team were investigating 'The Depths that Hunger', a sea shanty spread amongst posted sailors during the 16th Century (see Recovered Document 10-B for further details). Analysis reports indicated the vessel had been written off as lost to storms by local coast guard. However, an inquiry carried out by the Foundation revealed a large portion of water which had been intentionally avoided by search and rescue teams during their investigation[4](javascript:;).

Following reports of a potential hostile entity by exploration groups, Foundation naval vessel _Chimera_ was deployed to assess the threat. One hour after entry, site command received a distress signal from the vessel before _Chimera_ proceeded to open fire at the surrounding water. All orders to stop were ignored. This behaviour continued for approximately 20 minutes before a detonation onboard[5](javascript:;) tore a hole in the port side hull. Despite possessing the means to repair the damage, the crew retreated to the uppermost deck and the vessel sank. 62 lives were lost.

A secure perimeter was established and containment procedures were enacted on 06/08/1988. Further refinement of the perimeter was put in place in 1993 following additional D-Class testing.

* * *

**Recovered Document 10-B:** The following is a partial transcript of the shanty 'The Depths That Hunger', a song with potential links to SCP-5186. The document was recovered from the home of Dr. Gabriela Rening, one of the missing Columbian researchers, during the Foundation's initial investigation. According to Dr Rening's notes, the song itself has existed as far back as 1513.

> _'Beware beware the beast beneath, of eyes and shadow and maws and teeth,_  
> _With baleful gaze that chills the bone, beware beware the thing not known.'_
> 
> _'Beware beware the storms at night, that drag young sailors to their plight,_  
> _For down below a horror slumbers, beware beware the depths that hunger.'_
> 
> _'Beware beware the silent sea, its dreaded aura causing men to flee,_  
> _For in the depths the beast does lie, beware beware its watching eye.'_
> 
> _'Beware beware the one that waits, its endless maw sealing our fates,_  
> _No one is safe, neither old nor younger, beware beware the depths that hunger.'_
> 
> _'Beware beware the shifting tides, where deep below a darkness lies,_  
> _If mind and body you wish to keep, beware beware the broken deep.'_
> 
> _'Beware beware the lurking threat, no man can ever truly forget,_  
> _Ready to claim those in storm and thunder, beware beware the depths that hunger'_

**SCP-5186 Effects Test Log Excerpts**

* * *

**PROCEDURE:** D-1924 told to ride an unmanned dinghy into SCP-5186's range.

**RESULT:** Dinghy travels approximately 14 kilometres in before D-1924 suddenly falls unconscious.

**NOTES:** See Experiment Log D-1924 for further details.

* * *

**PROCEDURE:** D-3416 outfitted with SCUBA gear and a vocal transducer before swimming into SCP-5186's space approximately 20 metres below surface level.

**RESULT:** D-3416 swims 8 kilometres before suddenly halting. Subject refuses to look down, abandoning their breathing equipment in an attempt to quickly reach the surface. D-3416 drowns approximately 70 seconds later.

**NOTES:** 10 minutes prior to their death, D-3416 kept vocalising concerns about 'nothing but jaws just waiting to kill (them)'.

* * *

**PROCEDURE:** D-4725 outfitted with SCUBA gear and lowered into the epicentre of SCP-5186's range by helicopter.

**RESULT:** During the lowering procedure, the pilot suddenly initiates an emergency flight maneuver that throws both D-4725 and two other crew members into the water, killing them on impact.

**NOTES:** Following this incident, the use of aircraft for testing purposes has been prohibited. Consideration for extending SCP-5186's range 100 metres above sea level has been made.

> 
> **Testing Purposes:** To gain a better understanding of SCP-5186 and potentially locate a source of its anomalous effect.
> 
> **Additional Information:** Subject was equipped with standard audiovisual recording devices and a life jacket. Additionally, the unmanned dinghy has been fitted with an onboard camera for monitoring purposes. Exploration was observed by Dr. Harking at Site-39. For brevity, the following log begins approximately 10 minutes after initial entry into SCP-5186's space.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **D-1924:** Hey, doc? There ain't any sharks out here, right?
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** I can't say we know for certain I'm afraid.
> 
> **D-1924:** (_laughing_) Fair enough. (_whispered_) Sea air's probably fucking with me anyways.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** D-1924, please elaborate.
> 
> **D-1924:** I'm just not used to being so far out in the ocean, that's all. Got me feeling kinda antsy. Being stuck on this thing doesn't make things any easier, that's for damn sure.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** Just stay focused on the mission, please.
> 
> **D-1924:** (_sighs_) You got it, doc.
> 
> _Dinghy continues forward without issue. D-1924 is noticeably irritable, but remains seated. Subject travels for three kilometres without any major issues._
> 
> _After staring at the surrounding ocean for a short while, D-1924 becomes suddenly active. He stands up and begins to peer down into the water._
> 
> **D-1924:** (_long pause_) I think there's something down there.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** Pardon?
> 
> **D-1924:** In the water. I think there's something down in the water.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** (_away from mic_) We might have something. (_pause_) Did you see anything?
> 
> **D-1924:** No…I mean, I don't think so. But I can definitely feel it. Like—like it's staring at me. Right now, in fact.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** I see. (_pause_) Could you give us a quick look underwater please?
> 
> **D-1924:** Uhh, yeah…of course.
> 
> _Camera feed is angled downwards into the water. No life is immediately visible._
> 
> **D-1924:** I think it's too far down, doc. (_pause_) Whatever it is.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** Understood. Continue as normal, but try and keep an eye out for it if you can.
> 
> **D-1924:** Sure thing…
> 
> _The subject continues to check the sides of the boat for any movement below. Given the depth of the surrounding ocean, it's impossible to make anything out beyond 100 metres. The subject appears nervous of this fact._
> 
> _Dinghy travels an additional four kilometres before D-1924 begins shuffling away from the sides of the boat._
> 
> **D-1924:** Something…something's not right, doc. I don't think I should be out here.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** I'm afraid you don't have much choice in the matter.
> 
> **D-1924:** No, I'm serious. I'm not supposed to be out here. (_pause_) If I keep going I think it's going to hurt me.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** What's going to hurt you? Can you describe it?
> 
> **D-1924:** I—I don't know. Something wrong…in the dark. I can feel it staring at me—from everywhere. It's like it's everywhere underneath me.
> 
> _When asked to look into the water again, the subject is far more reluctant to do so. The camera feed fails to pick anything up._
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** D-1924, are you in any way afraid of the ocean?
> 
> **D-1924:** Wha—I mean, no, not really. (_sounding frustrated_) But this isn't the same, doc. It's real. It _feels_ real. Like I've always known whatever's down there isn't to be fucked with.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** And what do you think is down there, exactly?
> 
> **D-1924:** (_pause_) I don't think I want to be out here anymore.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** You're going to be fine, D-1924.
> 
> _Dinghy proceeds with its journey towards SCP-5186's epicentre. At this point, D-1924 has chosen to sit in the middle of the boat. The subject maintains eye contact with the floor._
> 
> _In the last few hours since D-1924 set off, they've travelled approximately 9 kilometres. Subject's breathing has become noticeably more rapid._
> 
> **D-1924:** (_whispered_) It's getting closer.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** What was that, D-1924?
> 
> **D-1924:** (_long pause_) It's just a feeling. I know it doesn't make any sense but—but it's freaking me out. Something _bad_ down there…it's—it's getting closer. And bigger. I think—(_glancing around_)—I think it might be too late.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** D-1924, what on earth are you talking about?
> 
> **D-1924:** It's like everything part of me wants to just—to just get out here. I've got to get out of here. (_whispered_) Please get me out of here.
> 
> _D-1924 begins moving towards the back of the boat._
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** Calm down. Everything's going to be fine. Just a little further now.
> 
> **D-1924:** No, doc! You don't get it—I've—I've got to get out. (_glancing around_) If you turn me around now, I might still make it.
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** You know that's not possible. Not yet anyways. We still haven't even _seen_ this 'creature'.
> 
> **D-1924:** (_heavy breathing_)
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** Now why don't you calm down for a moment and explain to me wha-
> 
> **D-1924:** No no no, there's no time. It's getting clo—(_choking sounds_)—it's nearly here, man! Just turn me the fuck around! Please, man!
> 
> **Dr. Harking:** (_away from mic_) Speed it up. We're getting close now.
> 
> _The dinghy's speed is increased by 5 knots. The sudden acceleration forces D-1924 on to the floor._
> 
> **D-1924:** No no no what are you doing? _What are you doing_?
> 
> _D-1924 is quickly taken past the 12 kilometer threshold at this point. Subject begs to be taken back, but all pleas are ignored._
> 
> _Another 2 kilometers go by and D-1924 falls completely silent. Subject has curled up in the foetal position, completely obscuring the camera. A faint dripping sound can be heard. Doctor Harking makes multiple attempts to communicate with D-1924, but to no response._
> 
> _The camera feed suddenly lights up once more as D-1924's left arm unfurls and hits the floor. The hand remains motionless. Subject's skin is incredibly pale and covered in moisture. The camera is slowly rotated upwards to face the sky as the dinghy tips D-1924's unconscious body onto its back._

[\- Experiment Log D-1924](javascript:;)

D-1924 was successfully recovered eight hours later following the recall of their vessel. Subject notably regained consciousness midway through the return journey, but showed an extreme reluctance to move from their current position. Amnestic therapy has proven effective at treating D-1924's manifested thalassophobia.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript 1**

**Exploration Purpose:** To locate the source of SCP-5186 and to identify any anomalous entities associated with it.

**Assigned Personnel:** Counter-Phobia Specialists Orion-12 ("Gage's Pioneers")

**Additional Information:** Orion-12 have all undergone experimental neural modifications, making them resistant to fear-inducing anomalies. All members were equipped with high pressure suits and recording equipment. Additional scanning equipment was distributed amongst all members. Exploration was observed by Doctor Harking at Site 39.

* * *

\[BEGIN LOG\]

**Ori-Markram:** Coms check, go.

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Sapolsky, loud and clear.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** This is O'Keefe.

**Ori-Greenfield:** Greenfield here.

**Ori-Markram:** You get all that, Doc?

**Dr. Harking:** Affirmative. Communications are stable. I assume you all remember the briefing?

**Ori-Markram:** Correct. Reports of some kind of aquatic hostile. Possibly cloaked. Big by the sounds of it.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** But there hasn't been any confirmed attacks, right?

**Dr. Harking:** It's hard to say. Getting anyone to talk about it clearly is—(_sigh_)—difficult.

**Ori-Markram:** And you're sure it's not just a cognitohazard? Some sort of perception alterer?

**Dr. Harking:** Well…(_sighs_) we really just don't know. I'm not happy about any of it, but truth be told we can't afford to ignore this. I want to cover every angle, and you guys are my best shot.

**Ori-Sapolsky:** (_whistles_) Looks like we've got a real doozy on our hands then.

**Ori-Markram:** Okay team, you know the drill. Once we're in the water, standard line formation. Then we'll fan out from there.

**Dr. Harking:** Happy fishing team.

_Orion-12 proceed to dive into the waters of SCP-5186. As expected, no team members show any symptoms of SCP-5186 exposure._

_Following several hours of exploration, the team fail to notice any signs of life. Sapolsky and O'Keefe are both elected to swim further down whilst the other two continue their search near the surface._

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Okay, preparations made. Moving out now.

_The diving team proceeds to move further down. Light levels at this depth are significantly reduced, and both team members are forced to activate their flashlights. Both camera feeds depict nothing but water._

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Not picking up much yet, Doctor. Visibility is definitely an issue.

**Dr. Harking:** And nothing is showing on the sonar, correct?

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Affirmative. Looks like we're the only ones down here right now.

**Site-39:** Understood. Continue closing in on that central location. If the effect radius hasn't moved in this long, then maybe it hasn't either.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Agreed.

_Both divers continue to swim for another two hours with no encounters._

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Hang on, I might have something here.

**Ori-Markram:** Go on.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** I made a quick signal check with the scanners, just to be sure. (_brief pause_) I'm actually picking up something beneath us. Unknown frequency. Could be a misfire though.

**Ori-Markram:** Hold on, O'Keefe. Doctor, do we know if there's any drone units down there? Something with a transmitter?

_Long pause._

**Dr. Harking:** Negative. All nearby units were pulled when you guys moved in. Is there a problem?

**Ori-Markram:** Unclear. We'll get back to you in a sec. O'Keefe, do you still copy?

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Yes, sir.

**Ori-Markram:** Triangulate that signal and investigate. Have Sapolsky go first if he can hear this. Me and Greenfield will try and meet you halfway.

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Understood.

_Team proceeds as planned. Sapolsky heads towards the signal source with the coordinates provided by O'Keefe. Approximately 20 minutes later, Sapolsky reports that he's reached the seafloor._

**Dr. Harking:** Okay Sapolsky, do you have eyes on the source?

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Negative. All I'm seeing is rock down here. Not much else.

**Dr. Harking:** But—but there has to be more to this…you're certain you're at the right coordinates?

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Yes sir.

**Dr. Harking:** And you didn't encounter anything along the way?

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Negative. Nothing but endless water I'm afraid.

**Dr. Harking:** I see. (_brief pause_) Wait. Can you confirm your current depth for me, Sapolsky?

**Ori-Sapolsky:** Hang on. Approximately (_incorrect value_).

_Long pause._

**Dr. Harking:** According to the topographical data within this area, you should have at least another 300 metres to go.

**Ori-Sapolsky:** (_brief pause_) Oh.

**Ori-Markram:** Shit.

_The rest of the team begin to quickly converge on the signal's position. Sapolsky is instructed to carry out a more thorough investigation of their surroundings._

**Dr. Harking:** What's down there?

**Ori-Greenfield:** It's too dark.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Flashlights aren't much use either.

**Ori-Markram:** Sapolsky, you got a better visual yet?

_No response._

**Ori-Markram:** Sapolsky? (_pause_) Michaels? (_pause_) Doc, Sapolsky isn't responding. Is he still on coms?

**Dr. Harking:** The connection's weak but yes, he should be. The camera feed is too patchy though. I can't make anything out.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** He can't be far from the signal source, sir.

**Ori-Markram:** Agreed. Everyone on me. Keep your eyes peeled.

_The remaining team members move in on Sapolsky's last known location. Besides the teams movements, there is no sound. Doctor Harking continues trying to make contact with the missing teammate._

_O'Keefe and Greenfield proceed to check the rocky surface Sapolsky initially encountered whilst Markram looks for him further upwards._

**Ori-Greenfield:** Nothing down here, sir. (_brief pause_) Just more rock.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Signal's definitely coming from here, but the thermal's aren't showing anything.

**Ori-Greenfield:** Just more rock.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** It really doesn't look like much up close. I'm coming to join you, Greenfield. Need to look at the wider picture maybe.

**Ori-Markram:** Just keep an eye out for Michaels, will you? (_pause_) Wait, up there!

**Dr. Harking:** What is it?

**Ori-Markram:** I've found Sapolsky. (_pause_) He's unresponsive, but breathing.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** (_exhales_).

**Ori-Markram:** I think he's gone catatonic.

**Ori-Greenfield:** Just…more rock.

**Dr. Harking:** Greenfield, your comms are lagging.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Wait…Greenfield?

**Ori-Markram:** What's wrong?

**Ori-Greenfield:** More…rock.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Greenfield, what is it?

**Dr. Harking:** I can't see anything. What's happening?

**Ori-Markram:** I don't know. (_pause_) Guys, what's going on?

**Ori-Greenfield:** More—more—rock?

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Sir, it's Greenfield. (_brief pause_) I think she's compromised.

**Ori-Markram:** Fuck. (_exhales_) Okay, whatever you do, O'Keefe, don't move. I'm heading towards your position now.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Sir, it's like she's…pointing at something. Beneath us.

**Dr. Harking:** Hang on—pointing at what exactly?

**Ori-Markram:** Forget it, Doc. The mission is out of the question now. O'Keefe, prepare for—

**Dr. Harking:** What's down there, operative?

**Ori-O'Keefe:** I—I don't know. (_brief pause_) It's hard to tell.

**Ori-Markram:** Just hold on, I'm nearly there.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** (_long pause_) I'm holding on.

**Ori-Markram:** Right I'm here, I'm here. (_pause_) Yep, same as Sapolsky. Dammit. Okay, O'Keefe, get the tethers out. You link with Greenfield and I'll take Sapolsky. I'm aborting the mission.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** The…mission?

**Ori-Markram:** Yes, the goddamn—(_long pause_). O'Keefe, what are you looking at?

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Looking…looking down…the mission?

**Ori-Markram:** …

**Dr. Harking:** What's wrong with the audio?

**Ori-Markram:** It's not the audio. (_sighs_) Operative down.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Down…nothing looking down…holding on to nothing.

**Dr. Harking:** What—Markram, what the hell is going on?

**Ori-Markram:** (_brief pause_) Something's down there. Something they've all seen. (_sighs_) Listen, I'm gonna try and drag O'Keefe up with me. Maybe—maybe we can figure out what this really is later.

**Dr. Harking:** I see…and the others?

**Ori-Markram:** Going back for them would be too dangerous. They'll have both sunk further down by now…I can't risk looking for them, Doc.

**Dr. Harking:** Understood, Markram. You're clear to retreat. (_away from mic_) Get an extraction team at the ready _immediately_.

**Ori-Markram:** (_whispered_) Let's get you home, buddy.

**Ori-O'Keefe:** Home…nothing but home…below…below me?

_Several hours pass before Markram surfaces with O'Keefe in tow. An evaluation reveals that the affected specialist experienced severe cognitive stress similar to a 'sudden loss of reality'. All attempts to revive O'Keefe from his catatonic state fail. Extraction of both Sapolsky and Greenfield is considered too risky; both specialists have since been deemed KIA. Reevaluation of exploration methods put into consideration._

**Exploration Video Log Transcript 2**

**Exploration Purpose:** To locate the signal source initially detected by Orion-12 and to uncover any potential links to SCP-5186.

**Assigned Personnel:** Deep Sea Rover Unit I-12

**Additional Information:** Following the events of Orion-12's exploration, an unmanned drone running the prototype GeLZ intelligence programme is deployed to counteract any potential memetics or cognitohazards. Using the signal source coordinates, the drone is deployed onto the seafloor and sent into SCP-5186's space. Exploration was observed by Doctor Harking at Site 39.

* * *

\[BEGIN LOG\]

**Dr. Harking:** Systems check, I-12. Are we good to go?

**Rover I-12:** Affirmative. Coordinates locked. Approaching target now.

_Rover proceeds to move towards Orion-12's last known location before extraction. The seafloor is somewhat uneven, making traversal difficult._

**Rover I-12:** Frequency detected. Faint. Beyond audible spectrum.

**Dr. Harking:** Ah, that must be what the last team picked up on. Can you synthesise it at all?

**Rover I-12:** Negative. Too weak. Must get closer.

_Drone continues forward. Several hours pass._

**Rover I-12:** Inconsistency detected. Abnormal incline encountered (62%).

**Dr. Harking:** An incline? (_brief pause_) You must be at the same point the Pioneer's got to.

**Rover I-12:** Sudden topographical material shift detected. Obtaining sample for identification. Please hold.

Processing…

Analysis:  
Calcium (85%)  
Phosphorus (5%)  
Unknown (?%)

Assessment: Foreign biological material identified.

**Dr. Harking:** Wait…you've found—you've found _it_? Is—is it alive?

**Rover I-12:** Negative. No life signs detected. Biological material appears to be in an advanced state of decay.

Type = Remains (Fossilized)  
Age = Unknown. No baseline decay model to compare.  
Size = Undetermined. Fragments appear partially imbedded.

Course of action?

**Dr. Harking:** Well I'll be damned…map out a full 3D layout if you can and send me the data. I want to get a better look at this thing…whatever it is.

**Rover I-12:** Understood. Beginning scanning procedure now.

_Doctor Harking doesn't hear from the rover unit for several more hours. Both its audio and visual feeds fail to pick up much in the dark._

**Dr. Harking:** I-12, what's taking so long?

**Rover I-12:** Scanning still in progress. Please hold.

Scan progress made: 00000000.1%.  
Estimated time until completion: 999999h

**Dr. Harking:** Wait, what? (_brief pause_) What's going on?

_Triangulation of the drone's signal shows that it's moving around in a continuous circle. It's travelled approximately 2 metres from its initial scan point._

**Rover I-12:** Initial interpretations available.

Analysis:  
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-

Error. Mapping cannot be accurately carried out.

**Dr. Harking:** (_sounding frustrated_) Why not?

**Rover I-12:** Error. Entity does not conform to baseline perceived reality. Cannot interpret visually. Cannot understand. What is entity?

**Dr. Harking:** (_sigh_) I was hoping you could tell me.

**Rover I-12:** Negative. Dimensions are illogical. Appearance is illogical. What is entity?

**Dr. Harking:** Forget about it for now, I-12. Abandon the scanning procedure.

**Rover I-12:** But what—but what—but what—but what—

**Dr. Harking:** Goddammit!

_At this point, Dr. Harking is forced to reboot the drone's systems and memory remotely. The drone's visual equipment is also deactivated to prevent further malfunctions. I-12's mission parameters are now only focused on extracting a copy of the frequency._

**Dr. Harking:** Okay okay okay. (_exhales_) Just breathe, Adam. I-12, do you have a better connection to the signal?

**Rover I-12:** Affirmative. Strength of frequency has increased significantly.

Abnormality detected. Signal appears to be emitting from biological matter. Method unknown.

Course of action?

**Dr. Harking:** From the wha—? Nevermind. Just get me a copy sent _immediately_. I need at least something to get my head wrapped around!

**Rover I-12:** Frequency successfully duplicated. Sending copy now.

**Dr. Harking:** (_camly_) Okay…this is good. Thank you I-12. That'll be all for now. (_away from mic_) You got it yet? (_pause_) Good. Play it back for me. See if you can make any sense of what the hell is go—

_All communications with Site-39 cut out as SCP-5186 makes its presence known. Evacuation protocols are quickly initiated._

ATTENTION: SITE-39 DIRECTOR'S NOTICE
====================================

* * *

### Following Doctor Harking's reckless behaviour, Doctor Langley will be taking over all research projects relating to SCP-5186 effective immediately. All other research efforts are to be temporarily put on hold until further notice.

**Incident-01:** Two days after Site-39's exposure to SCP-5186, on-site security teams were forced to respond to a Code Blue containment breach incident. According to the security logs, a Level 4 Clearance card was used to unlock SCP-████'s cell. A number of structures were damaged during the incident, including the recently established SCP-5186 Research Wing; a fire had reportedly ignited in one of the labs, destroying multiple sensitive documents.

14 staff were killed during the incident. Doctor Harking has remained unaccounted for. The following document was recovered from his office.
