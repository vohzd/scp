Strayer Density Matrix Mark I, Research Site-76

**Special Containment Procedures:** Area-03, located two kilometers beneath Hong Kong, has been created in order to contain SCP-4260. The containment chamber housing SCP-4260 has been augmented with a Strayer Density Matrix designed to coalesce and bind its disparate elements.

Maintenance of the Strayer Density Matrix is integral to SCP-4260's containment and requires a specialized team of technicians and speculative essophysicists[1](javascript:;). MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites") has been assembled for this expressed purpose and will perform any necessary repairs to the Matrix and operate it during the activation of Procedure 8917[2](javascript:;).

Procedure 8917 requires a joint operation between three mobile task forces, assembled to ensure its effective completion. The assigned task forces, denoted collectively as Amalgamate Force Omicron-45, and their functions are as follows:

*   **MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites"):** Assembled from numerous technicians proficient in the operation of Strayer Density Matrices and speculative essophysicists from RTF Iota-39 ("Gods and Monsters") who will assist in their direction.
*   **MTF Xi-2 ("Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly"):** An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in combat with essophysical, deity-class entities. MTF Xi-2 will engage SCP-4260 and terminate it, ending the initial stage of Procedure 8917.
*   **MTF Tau-900 ("Deliverance"):** An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in the location of civilians accidentally affected by a successful neutralization of SCP-4260. MTF Tau-900 will then terminate all targets and remove evidence of the procedure's efficacy.

Procedure 8917 is considered complete when the following criteria are met.

> 1.  SCP-4260 has been successfully terminated.
> 2.  The Strayer Density Matrix is fully operational.
> 3.  All affected civilians have been located and terminated.
> 4.  All evidence of Procedure 8917 has been removed.
> 5.  SCP-4260 has been resurrected.

The document detailing SCP-4260 uploaded to the Foundation intranet is to contain numerous omissions, in order to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260.

**Description:** SCP-4260 refers to the consciousness of an essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known universe. The effect of SCP-4260's existence has been well documented by almost every sapient culture. Termination of SCP-4260 has resulted in the neutralization of its primary anomalous effect until its resurrection during Procedure 8917.
