**Item #:**

**Object Class:**

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4773-2 has been moved to a 4 metre by 4 metre by 4 metre containment cell[1](javascript:;) at Site-96 for the purpose of testing. Containment Team CT-4773 are to remain on standby during the initial Preliminary Analysis phase of containment, which is ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-4773-2 is a brown, stuffed bear composed of synthetic fur and cotton. SCP-4773-2 will periodically levitate between 10 and 70 centimetres from the ground, and move in irregular patterns. Objects, entities, and surfaces near SCP-4773-2 may be wholly or partially imperceptible. This is considered normal behaviour.

Due to events, it is suspected that the anomaly possesses some secondary mind-affecting effects. This has been conclusively disproved. _This is considered normal behaviour._ See below.

**Tentative Description:** The following properties which may or may not relate to circumstances surrounding SCP-4773-2 are currently unconfirmed. Reader discretion is advised.

*   Mass, shape, etc. — baseline, normal physical properties
*   Movement (verified)
*   Changes in environment (unspecified (verified))
*   Removal of food.
*   Triggering of _unspecified_ subconscious instincts amongst personnel.
*   Improper disposal of food waste_, which was fully edible at the time_(?) by personnel
    *   Fate unknown.
    *   Currently three (3) sandwiches, four (4) packets of salted potato chips, and various assorted confectionery.
*   Movement (unverified)
*   Mind-affecting[2](javascript:;)
*   It's difficult (verified)
*   An inability to properly co
*   Staff are unable t
*   The existence of implications (unclear)(?)

**Addendum.1 | Testing Log:**

On April 10th, 1996, a proposal for testing involving SCP-4773-2 (intended to collect data on its anomalous visual effects) was approved by Site-96 staff, and conducted a week later.[3](javascript:;) For the test, the east-facing wall of SCP-4773-2's containment cell was lined with numbered square tiles, 25 cm in length, and observed via closed-circuit surveillance systems. Every hour, a Researcher made note of which tiles they were unable to view, either partially or fully.[4](javascript:;) Five hours into testing, procedures were halted, as no conclusive evidence was able to be drawn. The data-sets can be found below.

> SCP-4773-2 has been identified as non-anomalous and placed into storage. SCP-4773-1 was located in its containment chamber alongside the object, deceased due to dehydration — cremation of the body is scheduled for 04-30, and decontamination of the chamber is ongoing

[1](javascript:;). Size of chamber acts as a baseline for testing; see **Addendum.1** for more information.

[3](javascript:;). During this time, SCP-4773-2's containment cell was designated off-limits and personnel were advised to create an acceptable baseline by keeping interaction with related anomalies to a minimum. Also of note, SCP-4773-2's visual properties did not correspond to its location.

[4](javascript:;). SCP-4773-2's location can be ascertained from the placement of the red tile.
