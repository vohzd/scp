SCP-5738-E in containment after its retrieval.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5738-A through F are to be contained in separate standard secure item storage lockers at Storage Site-5738. SCP-5738-A through F can only be removed for testing purposes by personnel with a clearance level of 2 or higher.

**Description:** SCP-5738 refers to six individual pairs of iron prison shackles made to bind the subject's wrists, collectively designated SCP-5738-A to -F. Testing suggests that these shackles originate from the late 14th century of the Ottoman Empire. This is supported by the use of the shackles in a building formerly used for holding children taken to be raised as Janissaries[1](javascript:;).

When a living being is restrained with these shackles for a period of five minutes or longer, the affected subject will become an instance of SCP-5738-1. SCP-5738-1 will periodically be subject to breaks from the temporal flow of the universe for the remainder of their life. This sensation has often been described as "frozen" or "stopped" time.

These periods of temporal flow dissonance will occur at regular intervals to SCP-5738-1 instances. During these episodes, time will continue to flow only for the SCP-5738-1 instance and any matter within a radius of approximately 0.5 meters of any part of the instance[2](javascript:;). The length of these episodes varies greatly between individuals. However, the duration appears to be approximately the same length for each event a subject experiences.

**Discovery:** SCP-5738 was initially discovered after Silivri Prison in Istanbul, Turkey reopened and reports of anomalous events began occurring, despite the new management of the prison, including cases of sudden suffocation, impossible disappearances, and random necrosis of tissue[3](javascript:;). After it came to the foundation's attention, Researcher Flemming and Agent Fargo were dispatched to investigate under the guise of a government investigation. Five days into their investigation, a dispute with the warden ensued[4](javascript:;), resulting in a temporary imprisonment of both Foundation employees. At this time, both Researcher Flemming and Agent Fargo became SCP-5738-1 instances, discovering its properties.

**Addendum-1:** Upon returning, Researcher Flemming was appropriately disciplined for the incident causing him and Agent Fargo to become instances of SCP-5738-1. While Researcher Flemming was held as a temporary test subject, Agent Fargo was allowed to continue his work after 24 hours of observation, due to his clean record and demonstrated loyalty to the Foundation. During this time, he kept an audio diary of his episodes at the researchers' request. These logs are presented below.

> Agent William Fargo here, recording as requested by my superiors. I'm having my fourth episode now, so I don't have much to do other than record. I'm supposed to be transporting a D-class right now, but the central computer system doesn't exactly work when time's frozen, so the door won't even open until this is over. Might as well get a bagel while I wait; good thing I like 'em untoasted.
> 
> Well I guess I should start with an explanation. Because of SCP-5738, time and I, well, we don't exactly get along like we used to, and space isn't as fond of me either. I get stuck every once and a while in a moment of time, all alone. You'd think it would be exciting, powerful even, and at first it was, but now it's more inconvenient than anything else. Anyway, that covers the basics at least. If you'll excuse me, I've got a not-so-hot date with a bagel and the closest things to beds I can find.

> Hello again. It's only been four days, for the rest of the world at least, but it feels like it's been a week for me. They've been happening more frequently now, four or five times a day; that's what? A day and a half of stopped time per day? God, I better get used to living like this soon. I wish I could bring my shrink in here, or anyone for that matter.
> 
> I suppose of all the skips to get hit with, I certainly could have done worse. I'm still alive, and my brain still works like it should, for now at least, but I still wouldn't wish this on anyone. Several times a day, I'm stuck, no light or sound outside my half meter bubble, and the light fades away quickly enough anyhow. I get to take naps on the job now at least; though it only takes a couple minutes before I need to move and get some fresh air. Still… not many better ways to spend eight hours alone.

> I bought a bunch of extra power banks[5](javascript:;) for my phone yesterday, so at least I won't be completely bored out of my mind waiting for time to start up again. Outlets don't work as intended during episodes, it seems. I've also gotten into the habit of keeping food and water on me at all times, just in case. I don't want to end up like those prisoners.

> I've gotta be careful, I can bring people, skips, or anything in here with me if I get close enough; though I can't bring 'em all the way in without practically hugging them, and that doesn’t sound fun.  
> Apparently, I got too close to a D-class last time, just for twenty minutes or so. Parts of her right leg and right hand died while they were still attached, not that I could see any of it happening. All the light I get either comes from my phone or gets used up near instantly. At this point, I'm more used to being blind than not. Still though, I've gotta pay more attention. It's all too easy to get people hurt, or worse.

> I broke up with my girlfriend today. How am I supposed to explain that I never sleep at night anymore? Why I randomly teleport around the apartment? I can't share even half of my life with her anymore. Can't share it with anyone.
> 
> The worst part is that she's still here, crying. I can't see it anymore, thank fuck, but I know she's still there, upset and confused. Only seven and a half hours left to go. If I can get her out of here without having another episode that is…

I can’t move around enough to get fresh air. I’ve already gone through what feels like half the air, and I’ve only been here an hour. I’ve gotta figure a way out of here.

Agent Fargo was found dead via suffocation at 10:28am, on June 6th, 2019. His death was disguised as suicide by hanging at his apartment.
