**Item #: SCP-5107**

**Containment Class:** Keter

**Object Class:** Phenomenon

#### **Special Containment Procedures**

Due to the nature of the SCP-5107, direct containment is impossible.

All [public evidence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun) of SCP-5107 has been confiscated, discredited, or tampered with and is kept within the Site-51 Archive. Due to the efforts of Foundation assets in historic academia, SCP-5107 has been established as a hoax or illusion in the majority of public opinion. This cover will be perpetuated further if necessary.

#### **Description**

SCP-5107 was a phenomenon witnessed by approximately 50,000 people on 1917/10/15, in a field near Fátima, Portugal. At 12:37 GMT for approximately 10 minutes, the sun appeared to move erratically; this was corroborated through photographic evidence and testimony of Foundation agents present. SCP-5107 included an auditory event that analysis revealed to be a conversation in Ecclesiastical Latin, spoken in reverse by unknown entities, designated SCP-5107-A and SCP-5107-B.

#### **Discovery**

Between May and September of 1917, three children named Lucia Santos (9), Jacinta Margo (6), and Francisco Margo (7) gained local renown for their public testimonies of the "Virgin Mary" speaking to them from the sky above Fatima, Portugal. One month prior to SCP-5107, the children stated that the phenomenon would be visible to all in attendance on the date. Approximately 50,000 civilians were in attendance on 1917/10/15, including Foundation Junior Investigative Agents, Thomas Wright and Peter Gladsby. The following audio log was transcribed and translated for ease of access:

**Gladsby:** Pipe down! The, uh, the time is 12:37, and it uh, it appears the sun is moving in the sky above the field. I, uh, I don't really know how to–

**Wright:** Christ! You see th– I mean, the sun currently is weaving through the sky. It's doing, it's somersaulting in the sky.

**Gladsby:** Yes, the crowd is able to see it too, I don't, I don't know how it–

_\[Gladsby is interrupted by the auditory event, a female voice can be heard speaking Latin in reverse.\]_

**SCP-5107-A:**_\[Untranslatable\]_ can you come here? The light in the den is on the fritz again!

**Wright:** Holy shit, what is–

**Gladsby:** Shhh!

**SCP-5107-A** _\[Untranslatable\]_, you come down here right now– don't you ignore me!

**SCP-5107-B:** Me, what is it, mom? I'm really busy, you know.

**SCP-5107-A** Don't you speak that tone to me! The light's on the fritz again, can't you fix it?

**SCP-5107-B:** I just fixed it like, ten epochs ago. It's fine!

**SCP-5107-A:** That's what you said about the kitchen, look how that turned out. Supernova, right in the middle of dinner.

**SCP-5107-B:** That was one time mom! It's not gonna supernova, just put it back. Geez.

**SCP-5107-A:** Oh now you want me to fix it? It's always don't touch this, don't touch that. I'm not doing it.

**SCP-5107-B:** Fine, what's the pro– and just how did this happen? You bumped it didn't you! Trying to get a closer look I bet. That's why you don't want to touch it– you broke it in the first place, unbelievable.

**Gladsby:** Wow, okay, the sun has stopped moving its now back–

**SCP-5107-B:** Are they watching… They're watching! Mom, why are the _\[Untranslatable\]_ watching! I told you–

**SCP-5107-A:** You don't tell me young man, mister big shot, I raised you better than this, wait until your father… _\[SCP-5107-As voice begins to fade\]_

**SCP-5107-B:** Unbelievable.

_\[The crowd can be heard speaking and cheering, after 30 seconds of silence.\]_

**Gladsby:** Alright, play it back.

The agents present during SCP-5107 underwent extensive medical and psychological analysis and a large quantity of Compound N78E3 was discovered in their systems. Compound N78E3 is regularly used in the creation of Class-Y Mnestics and is theorized to be the cause of the localized perception of SCP-5107. The source of the Compound N78E3 present was not identified and no further SCP-5107 activity has occurred.
