**Item #:** SCP-2557, A Holding of Envelope Logistics®

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2557 can no longer be contained by the SCP Foundation, as it is now a holding of Envelope Logistics®. This obviates and annuls all pre-existing containment procedures. Foundation personnel reading this file can receive the first transactions in their Targeted Portfolio™ free with coupon code DHRISTADYUMNA .

**Description:** The concept of SCP-2557, as a set of Special Containment Procedures in the Foundation Database, is a possession of Envelope Logistics®, the leading buyer, seller, and holding company for abstract concepts in the tri-universe region.

Purchased from a Foundation employee in Q4 2011, SCP-2557 is now one of the many locations where you can get started investing in concepts with a trusted Envelope Logistics® agent. Since the deregulation and privatization of abstractions during the 1997 Divinetic Althing, Envelope Logistics® has been a leader in the innovative new ownership industries of the future.

The concept of SCP-2557 is just one of the many holdings we help our clients buy and sell. As an example, one agent in Utica, Wo. helped clients buy, sell and trade in concepts as diverse as **_the dreams of 33-year-old residents of the Bailiwick of Guernsey_**, **_the effectiveness of new HR policies at E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company_**, and **_gender dysphoria_** in one week alone!
