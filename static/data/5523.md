**Containment Update:** Following the incident involving Sid Rothenberg[1](javascript:;), governments affiliated with the Foundation have enacted an indefinite ban on the hunting and consumption of _cervidaes_ species. Rothenberg has been taken into Foundation custody, and is receiving intensive care.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the ecological niche SCP-5523 facilitates, removal of SCP-5523-1 specimens from forested areas is prohibited. Regions containing significant SCP-5523-1 populations have been cordoned from the public, with low-level security fences established around the perimeter of SCP-5523 affected areas.

Skeletal remains associated with SCP-5523.

**Description:** SCP-5523 is a Terminal[2](javascript:;)\-Class group of environmental changes, consisting of behavioral modifications and biological mutations affecting members of the Cervidaes family.[3](javascript:;) SCP-5523 events have been observed to occur after periods of severe environmental damage, such as forest fires or times of drought. SCP-5523 does not affect all individual Cervidaes specimens within a given area. Elderly populations or specific individuals experiencing sickness are are more susceptible to developing SCP-5523 then young and healthy populations. SCP-5523 consists of the ingestion of _Vaccinium vitis-idaea_[4](javascript:;) berries. _Vaccinium vitis-idaea_ are typically not eaten by Cervidaes specimens, due to the individual berries containing toxic substances.

SCP-5523 affected individuals[5](javascript:;) ingest great quantities of _Vaccinium vitis-idaea_, in which the poisonous materials will accumulate within the individual's bloodstream. After a period of approximately fourty-two hours, the SCP-5523-1 instance will die, leading to rapid decomposition occuring, without assistance from maggots or other decomposer organisms. Skeletal remains will develop _Vaccinium vitis-idaea_ saplings, along with spear-heading the growth of boreal plants, including Greenbrier, Poison Ivy, and Buckweed, all specimens of plants favored by Cervidaes. Following continued research, it has been determined that over ██ percent of forest growth worldwide has developed due to SCP-5523.

**Addendum No. 1:** Rothenberg Incident

Sid Rothenberg, a Canadian civilian, outdoorsman and biologist, experienced a period of confusion and delirium following ingestion of venison harvested from an SCP-5523-1 specimen. An outdoor journal, kept during the period of delirium, was recovered. The following is an excerpt.

> I am sick. There is a sickness within my body, I feel it inside me. The simple explanation is maggots, improperly cooked meat. But I feel as if there is something more, something that can explain why my mind is repeating words to me. '_Greenbrier._' '_Poison Ivy._' '_Buckweed._' Why are these words repeated to me? All speculation, at this point.  
> I'm resting by the fire, waiting for rescue. I'm looking at the forest around me, hearing the rutting of elk, the cawing of crow. The howl of a wolf. Something is clear to me. The Earth is dying, and we do not notice.  
> …  
> I fell asleep by the light of the moon, and I dreamt of my death, my skeleton, my bones, growing across the forest, like the roots of a tree. My death will bring the forest green, and the earth as brown as the first people.
