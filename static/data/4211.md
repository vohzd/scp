SCP-4211. Image has been rendered memetically sterile.

**Item #:** SCP-4211  
  
**Object Class:** Safe  
  
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4211 is contained in a standard Safe-class locker. Class-W mnestics are suggested while working with SCP-4211 to mitigate the mild memetic hazards it possesses. Personnel documenting SCP-4211 are to be rotated on a monthly basis to prevent irreversible changes to cognitive function.  
  
**Description:** SCP-4211 is the collective designation for specific diary entries with cognitohazardous properties — these written works contain cognitohazards to prevent reading of the item's true content unless certain conditions are met.[1](javascript:;) More specifically, the items encrypt their content via obfuscation, altering the text if the reader does not have access to the cipher key.

The cipher key is morphogenetic[2](javascript:;) resonance to an image and question prompt, presumably set by the author. In this way, only individuals with strong empathetic responses or similar brain function to the author may read the unaltered content of SCP-4211.

Attempts to transcribe, discuss, or copy SCP-4211's content result in the same outcome: individuals that have sufficient mental alignment to the author to view the content ordinarily will be able to understand the transcription/speech, while those that do not will experience the false versions. Exposure to the content of SCP-4211, encrypted or not, may result in temporary symptoms of:

*   Confusion
*   Amnesia
*   Headaches/Migraines
*   Heightened levels of visual snow
*   False memories
*   Sleep paralysis
*   Prosopagnosia[3](javascript:;)
*   Hallucinations

The diary containing SCP-4211 was found in the possession of Augustus Ehrlich Sr.[4](javascript:;), though it is assumed it was purchased from a third party. Due to the self-concealing nature of the anomaly, research into the content of the notebook has been limited. However, handwriting analysis shows that the entries have had multiple authors, and meta-analysis shows recurring mentions of family members drowning, even if the individuals have no such history.

1\. If mental alignment is not achieved, a pre-recorded entry by the same author will be seen instead.

2\. **DEFINITION — Morphogenetics:** The theory that memory is inherent in nature, and memories can be shared among populations without direct contact. For more information, see Sheldrake, R; (1966) "The Noosphere, Morphogenetic Fields, and the Akashic Records" _The Foundation Journal of Mental Sanitation_ vol 7(1) pages 1-14.

3\. A neurological condition characterized by the inability to recognize the faces of familiar people.

4\. POI-9873 (deceased). Multiple SCP objects were discovered in his possession upon his death.
