A 20th century painting focusing on SCP-5610.

**Item #:** 5610

**Containment Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5610 events are to be minimally monitored.

Meanwhile, a study of all cultures with a particular focus on shame and facades[1](javascript:;) is to be initiated for any relations with SCP-5610. All historical documents related to felines are to be also investigated.

**Description:** SCP-5610 is an anomalous entity that is only observable by individuals with a cognitive resistance value of 5.6 and above. Approximately 56 percent of Japan's population has been found to have an instance of SCP-5610 resting atop of their head. However, no discomfort is felt by the subject these instances are resting on.

As a subject's behavior in public becomes more congruent to their behavior in private, the instance of SCP-5610 becomes increasingly detailed. This continues until it produces one of two results: either the instance would vanish, or in approximately six percent of all cases, it transforms into a non-anomalous cat(_Felis catus_) and jumps off the subject's head.

SCP-5610 is prominently featured in haikus; living authors, when questioned, remember it. Notable ones are translated below.

It is humankind  
To put a cat on the head[2](javascript:;)  
To love and hate swords  
\-_Oda Nobunaga, 1580_

  

When a child suckles,  
The cat inside him also does,  
Partnered on rough paths  
\-_Basho, 1672_

  

Are we not all cats  
On heads of weak, chatting mice  
Or hardened tigers?  
\-_Emiri Takagata, 1923_

  

To the barrack bed,  
An old cat jumps from my head  
Meowing with pity  
\-_Jou Takamiki, 1944_

  

Bored, Oneko[3](javascript:;) sighs,  
Telling me to cry for him  
Yet I save face, tears  
\-_Deo Takamiki, 1944_

  

Banging the weak wall,  
From my rotten, though shined crown  
A cat skitters through  
\-_Aiko Torikatsu, 1976_

  

The cat leaves haughty,  
My thoughts, like leaves on a pond  
Float in unison  
\-_Moeka Horinami, 1980_

  

Reflections of mine  
A cat claws back from the top  
I smile sadly now  
\-_Haruki Murakami, 1998_

  

**Update:** Several historical records in Egypt, dating as far back as 3500 B.C. have been noted for indicating manifestations of SCP-5610.
