The front cover of SCP-5026's DVD case.

**Item #:** SCP-5026

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5026 is to be stored inside of a standard Anomalous Item storage locker at Site-76 at all times. As of 02/13/2003, all future experiments involving SCP-5026 are to be suspended until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-5026 is a narrative-driven motion picture of undetermined length whose protagonist's physical appearance and personality mimic that of its current viewer, and whose plot structure shapes around its current viewer's personal experiences and collective identity. At some point during SCP-5026's screening, its current viewer will become severely amnesic, losing all knowledge regarding the object's existence, along with all knowledge regarding their own personal history and identity.

SCP-5026 is contained on a standard capacity DVD, and according to its cover sheet, was released as direct-to-video media under the title of _Find Me_ by the _YourStories_ production company sometime in 2001. Despite this, no records of the company’s existence, outside of the DVD itself, have been verified.[1](javascript:;) A marketing blurb located on the back of the DVD cover claims the object to be "the first movie ever created where _you_ are the protagonist," with its description points recommending solo viewing experiences exclusively. The back cover also lists SCP-5026's production staff, including its director, who is credited as Alan Smithee.[2](javascript:;)

In all documented cases, SCP-5026 can only be activated by a first-time viewer, and only when that viewer is completely alone. The presence of more than one viewer, a previous SCP-5026 viewer, and/or any type of technological recording device before SCP-5026's activation will result in SCP-5026's lack of activation entirely. This phenomenon also extends to any viewer or recording device that enters a viewable/audible proximity of SCP-5026 at any point during the actual screening of the object, as the screening will be automatically stopped and the object's properties will immediately manifest in its original viewer. (See Experiment D-49913)

> **Foreword:** _The following log is a plot description compiled from handwritten recounts of SCP-5026's screening. Due to SCP-5026's nature, this log is considered incomplete, and its contents cannot be verified with absolute certainty._
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> The protagonist of SCP-5026 (who will now be referred to as SCP-5026-1) wakes up in a medical operating room wearing nothing but a hospital gown. After assessing its situation, SCP-5026-1 wanders the area and discovers that it is in a completely vacant healthcare facility. While it wanders the facility, it comes across a ringing telephone in a reception area that it picks up and answers.
> 
> **Note:** _SCP-5026 appears to have the ability to present itself in any known language. All spoken dialogue from the characters communicating within SCP-5026 will be catered to the individual viewer's native tongue._
> 
> English Translation:  
>   
> \> CALLER:  
> **_"All employees must enter through the staff door."_**
> 
> Before SCP-5026-1 has a chance to respond, the caller hangs up the telephone. SCP-5026-1 then looks nearby to see a door marked as "Staff Only." It enters through the door to find itself in a completely different environment than that of the healthcare facility. It now stands within a specific workplace that is similar to that of the viewer's last registered employment.[3](javascript:;) This workplace contains dozens of employees that each perform their appropriate workplace duties. SCP-5026-1 tries numerous times to gain these employees' attention, although none of them actually acknowledge its presence. Sometime during these attempts, an intercom announcement from an undetermined location is made.
> 
> \> INTERCOM:  
> **_"Please report to management immediately."_**
> 
> After this announcement is made, SCP-5026-1 immediately notices a nearby office that is labeled with the word "Management". It enters the office to find a silhouetted figure sitting behind a desk inside.  
>   
> \> FIGURE:  
> **_"Sit down."_**  
>   
> SCP-5026-1 hesitates for several moments before following the request of the figure.  
>   
> \> FIGURE:  
> **_"Why do you think you're here?"_**  
>   
> From what is understood, SCP-5026-1 will respond back to the silhouetted figure's question with its own inquiries regarding its current condition and surroundings, all of which will be phrased similarly to how the viewer would respond in its situation. Regardless of the inquiries asked, the figure will always respond to SCP-5026-1 through vague and non-descriptive answers. After SCP-5026-1 asks all of its inquiries, the figure will then chuckle to itself and say the following:
> 
> \> FIGURE:  
> **_"Nothing matters. Nothing you can say will change what you've done."_**
> 
> \> SCP-5026-1:  
> **_"What have I done?"_**
> 
> \> FIGURE:  
> **_"You've just lived your life."_**
> 
> The figure then presses a previously unseen button under its desk, causing SCP-5026-1 and its chair to fall through a trapdoor underneath them. SCP-5026-1 falls out of the office and several meters below into another room, eventually landing on the room's floor. SCP-5026-1 stumbles up from the floor to find itself in a mostly barren concrete room that has no visible exits. The only object in the room is a large television monitor, which quickly flickers on as SCP-5026-1 notices it. SCP-5026-1 then approaches the monitor with caution and watches it intently.
> 
> Images from what is assumed to be SCP-5026-1's life will quickly flash in a montage-like succession across the monitor. These images are claimed to be heavily associated with the viewer's own personal life experiences, both positive and negative. Common examples include SCP-5026-1 partaking in personal hobbies, having romantic encounters, succumbing to personal vices, and experiencing personal traumatic events. As SCP-5026-1 watches the monitor, its exact reactions will vary, although it is usually distraught and/or frightened. SCP-5026-1 continues to do this until a disembodied voice calls out to it.  
>   
> \> DISEMBODIED VOICE:  
> **_"Are you satisfied?"_**  
>   
> SCP-5026-1 looks up in shock towards what is assumed to be the source of the voice.  
>   
> \> SCP-5026-1:  
> **_"What!?"_**  
>   
> \> DISEMBODIED VOICE:  
> **_"Are you happy?"_**  
>   
> SCP-5026-1 does not respond.  
>   
> \> DISEMBODIED VOICE:  
> **_"Do you believe that you have led a fulfilling life?"_**
> 
> At this point SCP-5026-1 will respond with one of two answers: **Yes** or **No**. Regardless of its response, the dialogue always continues as follows:
> 
> \> DISEMBODIED VOICE:  
> **_"I see."_**  
>   
> Suddenly, from the other side of the room, a wall opens to reveal an elongated hallway.  
>   
> \> DISEMBODIED VOICE:  
> **_"We can still give you a choice."_**  
>   
> SCP-5026-1 collects its composure before it reluctantly enters the hallway, which then transforms into a suspended platform that stretches forward into a black void. At the end of the platform, there is a table with two unmarked buttons protruding from it. One button is a bright green, and the other is a dark red. SCP-5026-1 walks forward across the platform towards the table, eventually reaching it and stopping. It stares at the buttons for several moments until the disembodied voice is heard again.
> 
> \> DISEMBODIED VOICE:  
> **_"Would you like to start over?"_**  
>   
> **Note:** _This the final known plot point that has been reliably recounted by all of SCP-5026's previous viewers. All other information that has been obtained regarding what occurs after this point is currently considered inconclusive._

[\- Close 'Experiment D-49913'](javascript:;)

> **SUBJECT PROFILE:**
> 
> **Classification:** D-49913  
> **Legal Name:** David Hawthorn  
> **Gender:** Male  
> **Age:** 42  
> **Convicted Crime(s):** Domestic Terrorism, Murder  
> **Additional Information:** Radicalized by political extremists while employed as an undercover journalist for a national news outlet.
> 
> **EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION:**
> 
> On 09/30/2002, subject D-49913 was exposed to a random experiment variable at the request of Project Director Dr. Taylor. Shortly after the experiment began, D-49913 was instructed by Dr. Taylor to pause the playback of SCP-5026 approximately 20 minutes into its screening. After the allotted time had passed, researchers checked the testing area to discover that SCP-5026 was still activated and that D-49913's memory was still intact, retaining all information about his past history and personal identity. D-49913 was then escorted out of the testing area and back to his cell where he was then left unattended to for 6 hours. The DVD player containing the paused instance of SCP-5026 was left powered on and untouched during this time, and D-49913 was still left unaffected by SCP-5026's properties.  
>   
> Because of this phenomenon, D-49913 was then kept on-site and given daily routines and maintenance tasks to follow while being monitored by researchers over the next 4 months. During this time frame, the DVD player remained powered on and paused, and D-49913 was still left unaffected by SCP-5026's properties.  
>   
> **Updated Addendum:** Approximately 24 hours after the initial pausing of SCP-5026, researchers discovered that the screening had succumbed to severe video glitching in its paused state, even though the object itself still appeared functional.  
>   
> On top of the glitching video the words _**"HELP ME**"_ in a white font were visible. These words remained static for 3 hours before they disappeared. Approximately 30 minutes after the original text had vanished, more appeared in its place. This text was also printed on the screen with the same font, and read the following:  
>   
> _**"CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?"**_  
>   
> Dr. Taylor, believing this to be an attempt by SCP-5026 as a form of communication, decided to conduct further experiments directly involving these texts (which will now be referred to as SCP-5026-2) while SCP-5026 was still in its paused state.

[\- Close 'Incident D-49913'](javascript:;)

> On 01/18/2003, approximately one week after D-49913's last interview with Dr. Taylor, and approximately 4 months after D-49913's initial pausing of SCP-5026, a calculation error during testing with SCP-████ resulted in a seven-second power surge that deactivated SCP-5026's DVD player.
> 
> D-49913, who had been in his cell at this time, was found in a panicked and amnesic state shortly thereafter, and was terminated under the orders of Site-76 Director Dr. Matthews. After D-49913's termination, SCP-5026 was then tested and found to have returned to its initial form, which included the disappearance of SCP-5026-2 in its entirety.
> 
> When Dr. Taylor was informed of the incident's aftermath and D-49913's termination, she appeared emotionally unaffected, and has not commented on D-49913, SCP-5026-2 or any of the experiments that occurred with SCP-5026 since.  
>   
> **Updated Addendum: Incident Involving Dr. Taylor - 02/09/2003**:  
>   
> Approximately 3 weeks after Incident D-49913, Dr. Taylor was found by site staff in the aftermath of an isolated and unauthorized viewing attempt of SCP-5026. By the time she was discovered, Dr. Taylor had already succumbed to SCP-5026's properties and had no recollection of her personal identity, including her employment or history with the Foundation.  
>   
> Since this incident, Dr. Taylor has undergone extensive psychological rehabilitation, but she has been unable to recover any of her memories. As of 02/13/2003, all future experiments involving SCP-5026 are to be suspended until further notice.
