**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4378 is contained inside a 5 liter stainless steel mixing bowl. The bowl is enclosed within the former kitchen of the United States White House with access via a single outward swinging door. This door is to be kept locked at all times. All movement and sound within 20 meters of the object is to be kept to a minimum; under no circumstances is it to be disturbed.

An X-Class cognitohazard is placed within the immediate vicinity of the kitchen door leading to SCP-4378, preventing White House personnel from either perceiving or approaching it.

SCP-4378 within its containment bowl following removal by Secretary of State ████████ █████

**Description:** SCP-4378 is a single uncooked De Cecco-brand lasagna noodle. Disturbing SCP-4378[1](javascript:;) causes physical objects within its range of effect to be transferred to what is theorized to be another dimension _\[Designated SCP-4378-A.\]_ The range of this effect is proportional to the amount of disturbance. The relational growth rate of the object's anomalous properties is unknown, though it is estimated to be x∗10αx \* 10^\\alpha (with xx being the theoretical number of disturbed electrons and α\\alpha being the Fine-Structure Constant.)

Entities transferred to SCP-4378-A are irrecoverable _\[Designated SCP-4378-#, numerically by chronological order of disappearance.\]_ Responses can be sent by manipulating cooked noodles[2](javascript:;) within 5 meters of SCP-4378.[3](javascript:;) Extensive communication with subjects has been conducted. It is not understood how subjects continue to exist within SCP-4378-A, as subjects seem to lose all concept of self while still retaining their names. A Model M130 Remote Communication Bot has been used in attempts to communicate with the subjects, they have proven unsuccessful. A sentient interviewer is required in order to communicate with subjects within SCP-4378-A.

Subjects have been incapable of describing SCP-4378-A in any coherent manner, however it is possible to send recording equipment to SCP-4378-A for brief periods of time. After approximately 10 minutes and 17 seconds, the equipment is ejected from SCP-4378-A, retaining any recorded data. SCP-4378-A appears to be a brightly lit void loosely filled with dried pasta, primarily spaghetti noodles.[4](javascript:;) Noodles have been observed spontaneously manifesting within the void during recordings, but the location or cause of their creation is currently unknown.

Communication with subjects sent through SCP-4378-A has been limited, usually only given in a simplified stream of consciousness that has proven difficult to understand, exacerbated by the required method of communication. When sent to SCP-4378-A subjects seem incapable of understanding how they are communicating with researchers and that they were once human, but retain their name. _\[See Interview Log SCP-4378-#\]_

SCP-4378 was discovered immediately following the sudden disappearance of Secretary of State ████████ █████. _\[Designated SCP-4378-1\]_ SCP-4378-1 was observed spontaneously disappearing on security footage recorded on ██/██/████ taken from the White House kitchen. The brief video shows SCP-4378-1 opening an upper cabinet, taking hold and opening a De Cecco Lasagna Noodle box, removing SCP-4378 from the box. SCP-4378-1 then spontaneously disappeared causing SCP-4378 to fall, landing in the stainless steel mixing bowl of which SCP-4378 is now contained. It is unknown why SCP-4378-1 did not disappear when the box containing SCP-4378 was disturbed but it is speculated that SCP-4378's anomalous properties did not manifest until it was removed from its container.

Note from Project Lead Dr. Lark:

Pending further review, I would also like to add the observation that gravity did not seem to cause SCP-4378 to manifest its anomalous properties. When SCP-4378-1 dropped SCP-4378 into the bowl, nothing happened. This is reason to believe that SCP-4378 only reacts when disturbed by a force outside of astronomical constants. Possibly only a sentient outside force, but that would have incredible implications considering Incident R-4378-M2. But that is something I am going to consider another time. There are already enough unknowns about this damned piece of flour, egg, and water.

For approximately a week following SCP-4378-1's disappearance, various noodles found throughout the White House were discovered arranged in messages. The recorded instances of these are as followed:

> 1.  A single piece of spaghetti found at the bottom of President █████ ███████'s bowl arranged in cursive writing spelling out "hello?" The president noticed this as a coincidence and pointed it out to his wife, to which they both remarked at the "chances of that happening."
> 2.  A bowl of alphabet soup given to President █████ ███████'s daughter. The daughter pointed out to her father that the soup seemed to be randomly rearranging into various words including: nothing, ████\[nickname for SCP-4378-1\], ergo sum, and life.
> 3.  A bowl of leftover linguine found on top of the mini-fridge of the Chief of Staff's office in the West Wing. The linguine was left out for approximately 2 days, allowing it to dry. All linguine was found arranged into the word "thirst." It is speculated that this happened while the linguine was still pliable and then dried out.

Further testing has proceeded to better understand SCP-4378's anomalous properties as well as attempting to discover a way to retrieve subjects back from SCP-4378-A. All current attempts have been unsuccessful.

[▼ Close File](javascript:;)

SCP-4378-# Interview Protocol

FOLLOW ALL PRECAUTIONS AS STATED. FAILURE TO FOLLOW MAY RESULT IN UNINTENDED TERMINATION OF INTERVIEWER.

1.

Interviewer is to be safeguarded from the X-Class Cognitohazard.

2.

Interviewer is to bring 400g of recently (within 30 minutes of interview) pre-prepared spaghetti noodles.

3.

Interviewer is to stand as still as possible while near SCP-4378. _Remember, we are still unaware of how much movement will cause SCP-4378 to activate._

4.

As per the preparation protocol, use of beta blocker _propranolol_ is highly advised and only required if your supervisor deems it necessary.

5.

An outfit consisting entirely of non-abrasive and minimum-friction materials will be provided. No other articles of clothing are allowed.

6.

Do not touch the bowl containing SCP-4378 under any circumstances.

Interview Instructions

1.

A sheet of questions will be given to you by your supervisor prior to the interview, following the application of the X-Class Cognitohazard safeguard. These questions are to be memorized.

2.

Approach SCP-4378 without lifting your feet. The provided shoes will allow you to shuffle across the floor. Take caution not to fall due to slipping.

3.

On countertop near bowl containing SCP-4378, arrange the cooked noodles as instructed in the interview questions. Cursive lettering is appropriate.

4.

Leave noodles in place for as much time as needed for SCP-4378-# to respond. This has been anywhere from instant to 3 hours. Movement during this period is to be kept to an absolute minimum.

5.

Memorize any responses.

6.

Repeat until all questions have been answered.

7.

Collect all noodles used and carefully exit the vicinity of SCP-4378.

8.

Note all answers in the provided interview log. (_Researcher Note: Please revise. Memorization of answers appears unnecessary when we have access to advanced recording devices. Suggestion: Implant of Ocular Visual Image Recorder._)

_Note from Compiler: Incident R-4378-M2 has proven incredibly difficult to document considering the nature of the event. Use of the Leifman Protocol[5](javascript:;) has made interviewing any persons present during the incident impossible. Most documents compiled in this report have been totally expunged from the public record and are now likely only present in this report._

**Memo from President ███████'s Secretary Dated ██/██/████**

**MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT**  
  
_Subject: Preparations for Earthquake_  
  
In regards to the earthquake advisory put forth by the US Geological Survey. Evacuation of all government buildings have been ordered and should be complete within the hour.  
  
Secret Service officials should be accompanying you to Safe House 5 at 11:30 AM. Vice President █████ ████████ will join you along with your families. The US Geological Survey estimates the earthquake and any aftershocks should cease after 3:30 PM, after which you will be escorted back to the White House. However, if the White House has been damaged we will observe the Hoover Standard until the all-clear is given.  
  
It is not expected that this will be a catastrophic earthquake and will likely only require the minimum of precautions. Regardless, I have been told by Agent York that the Secret Service is prepared for all possibilities.

**Memo from Dr. Lark to Mobile Task Force Eta-7**

Meiersdorff, we have a Class J incident on our hands. Round up the team and head to Washington DC immediately. You are to locate the safe house connected to the White House, I have been told that it is found through a hidden door in the White House Kitchen.  
  
And be careful of any aftershocks. A 190EI Bot has already been sent to the object and should negate any risks, but be careful.[7](javascript:;) We do not know the full capacity of 4378's effects. It is possible that an event could still occur even while 4378's stabilized.  
  
If the President is located, bring him to the staging location and perform the Leifman Protocol. If he is not located, return to the staging location for further instructions.
