SCP-5072 in action.

* * *

#### Special Containment Procedures:

The entirety of Algonquin Provincial Park (formerly managed by Ontario Parks) located in south-central Ontario, Canada has been claimed by the Foundation. Annual checks on the park's environment are held in order to maintain its well-being.

Due to the public nature of SCP-5072, size of Algonquin Provincial Park, and SCP-5072 instances' requirement for interaction, entry to the park has not been restricted.

* * *

#### Description:

SCP-5072 is the collective designation for all instances of _Photuris Pennsylvanica_[1](javascript:;) inhabiting Algonquin Provincial Park. Though SCP-5072 are located throughout Algonquin Provincial Park, they are especially abundant at Canoe Lake, a popular tourist spot.

SCP-5072 instances appear to show no deviations in appearance from normal Photuris Pennsylvanica; however, all instances are capable of communication. Words are formed by large groups of SCP-5072 maneuvering themselves in the shape of letters to form sentences. Additionally, instances appear to secrete their bioluminescence in order to substitute for conventional methods of writing on paper.

When a crowd of individuals appear at Canoe Lake at night, SCP-5072 will proceed to entertain them with a light show. This is achieved by an abundance of instances gathering in one area, telegraphing themselves in a way capable of forming different shapes and structures. When the performance concludes, instances will proceed to disperse and wait for the next wave of visitors.

Whenever the rate of visitors for Algonquin Provincial Park declines noticeably, SCP-5072 instances become less frequent, and appear to be far more unresponsive. If not attended to, SCP-5072 instances will continue to become less frequent until they disappear from the park.

##### Addendum One — Initial Contact/Discovery

* * *

SCP-5072 was discovered when a Foundation researcher entered Algonquin Provincial Park during their leisure time. The following individual had heard of a popular tourist spot for its "firefly light shows". A recording of the entire SCP-5072 event has been logged and transcripted.

[• Light Show Performance •](javascript:;)

[○ Close Document ○](javascript:;)

**<Begin Recording: 00:00:00>**

_**00:00:24:** \[The sky is dark and the water within Canoe Lake appears to be polluted. Half of the surrounding trees are dead. SCP-5072 instances slowly gather at the center of lake. There are a total of 11 people in the area.\]_

_**00:00:55:** \[A small ball is formed in front of the individuals.\]_

_**00:01:01:** \[The crowd is visibly pleased. The SCP-5072 instances proceed to entertain the individuals with a small light show.\]_

_**00:01:30:** \[Half of the instances branch away from each other, forming a large line. The instances flash their lights in alternation.\]_

_**00:01:47:** \[The instances move up and down, as they approach the crowd. They start to form a circle while still moving up and down.\]_

_**00:02:20:** \[The instances start to fly to the air, clumping together.\]_

_**00:02:41:** \[A small firework comprised of the instances is visible. The crowd applauds.\]_

_**00:03:00:** \[The rest of the individuals leave. The SCP-5072 instances start to disperse.\]_

**<End Recording: 00:03:10>**

##### Addendum Two — Interview

* * *

Two days after the initial event, the same Foundation researcher was dispatched within Algonquin Provincial Park to interview SCP-5072 when visitors left the premises. The following is a transcription of the interaction with SCP-5072.

[• SCP-5072 Interview •](javascript:;)

[○ Close Document ○](javascript:;)

**Interviewer:** Femilia Raynes  
**Interviewee:** SCP-5072

**Note:** Some sentences have been combined for ease of use.

* * *

**<Begin Log>**

_\[Femilia is in Canoe Lake within Algonquin Provincial Park. A group of SCP-5072 instances are in the center of the lake. The instances start forming words by maneuvering their bodies to converse with her.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Hello, visitor!

**Femilia:** Hello. I saw your show the other day!

**Transcribed Message:** Really?!

**Femilia:** Definitely.

_\[The instances swirl around.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Did you enjoy the show?

**Femilia:** It was great. _(Smiles)_ Anyways, do you mind answering a few questions for me?

**Transcribed Message:** Of course!

**Femilia:** Great! First and foremost, how long have you been entertaining your visitors?

**Transcribed Message:** Hm… We don't know?

**Femilia:** You don't know? As in, it's been so long that you don't remember?

**Transcribed Message:** Kind of! We just started performing ever since those friendly guys showed up!

**Femilia:** Friendly guys?

**Transcribed Message:** You don't know them? They're the ones who helped us become so popular!

**Femilia:** Unfortunately, no. Who are they?

_\[The instances fly up and down.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Uh, they're the owners of this place! We think. We remember seeing the word "Parks" in there?

**Femilia:** Parks… I see. Where are they now?

_\[The instances' lights begin to dim. They respond less energetically.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** We don't know.

**Femilia:** Huh? You don't know?

_\[The instances fly up and down.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** We haven't seen them in a long time.

**Femilia:** What happened to them?

**Transcribed Message:** They helped us build the park from the very beginning! But now they're gone. We haven't seen them since.

**Femilia:** (Frowning) I see…

**Transcribed Message:** Every since they left, our home has started to dwindle. We used to be super popular! So many people came to visit us, and we loved playing for them! But since they left, we haven't been getting as many visitors.

**Femilia:** I'm sorry.

_\[The instances shake.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** No no, don't be! We've just been lonely. Not many people visit us anymore, and less of our kind have gotten in the mood to dance for our visitors.

**Femilia:** Is there… something I can do to help?

**Transcribed Message:** Our home. It's in a terrible state if you haven't noticed already.

_\[The instances' lights blink for a few seconds.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** We're sorry to bother you. But we earnestly ask that you help us fix our home. Ever since the friendly people left, we haven't been cared for, and neither has our home. Because of this, less people want to come visit us, and we're losing our popularity. We promised the friendly people to make their park the best in the world, but at this state, we're not going to be able to fulfill that goal.

_\[Their lights dim again.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Again, we're sorry to bother you. You're just a visitor, and yet you're trying to help our problems.

**Femilia:** Don't be down. We'll definitely help you out.

_\[Their lights brighten.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Really?!

**Femilia:** Really.

_\[The instances start to swirl around for a few seconds.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** If you could, can you also tell us about the friendly guys? We don't know what happened to them, and if something bad happened, we want to help them out too.

**Femilia:** Sure. Of course.

**Transcribed Message:** Thank you, miss!

##### Addendum Three — Ontario Parks

* * *

Three days after the interview with SCP-5072, the Foundation had launched an investigation into Ontario Parks, a department under the Government of the Province of Ontario. The investigation yielded little to no results for the next two weeks. During this time, the rate of visitors within Algonquin Provincial Park has declined even further than it was before. Additionally, light shows from SCP-5072 were less frequent.

As a result of the investigation, the Foundation had come to the conclusion that Ontario Parks neglected to sustain the environmental well-being of their owned lands. It should be noted that the Ontario Minister of the Environment has stepped down until recently, and a new individual has been placed in their position. Despite this, the reason for the sudden change in actions for the company is currently unknown.

The Foundation, aware of the recent actions, negotiated a covert land transfer with the Government of Ontario to claim Algonquin Provincial Park. The park was successfully handed over.

* * *

##### Addendum Four — Final Interaction

* * *

Two weeks subsequent to the initial purchase of Algonquin Provincial Park, Foundation researcher Femilia Raynes was dispatched as a tourist to check on SCP-5072. The content of the interaction has been logged and transcripted.

[• Final Interaction •](javascript:;)

[○ Close Document ○](javascript:;)

**Foreword:** The following is not an interview, but a check on the well-being of SCP-5072 and it's environment. Some sentences have been combined for ease of use.

* * *

**<Begin Log>**

_\[Femilia is standing in a forest near Canoe Lake. There is a group of SCP-5072 instances in the distance performing in front of a crowd. Another group of instances are gathered in front of Femilia.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Welcome back, visitor! We were getting worried you wouldn't show up again.

**Femilia:** _(Chuckles)_ Don't worry about it. Thanks for welcoming me.

_\[The SCP-5072 instances flutter around.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** Thank you for helping our home! There are a lot more visitors now compared to before!

**Femilia:** You're welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't get any further information on your friends, the people from Ontario Parks.

**Transcribed Message:** It's okay. We'll meet them sometime, hopefully.

**Femilia:** I think so as well.

_\[The instances fly around Femilia in a circle.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** We're a lot more popular now, even more than when we first debuted! It's all thanks to you and your advertising as well. We heard our visitors mention how there was a 'firefly attraction' at our home!

**Femilia:** You flatter me. I like it here, how am I not going to help a place I enjoy staying at?

_\[A few instances start landing on Femilia. Their lights blink while they sit on her shoulders.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** I'm glad you enjoy our home! Say, miss, do you mind telling us your name?

**Femilia:** It's Femilia. Femilia Raynes.

**Transcribed Message:** Then, Ms. Femilia, we must pay you homage! Unfortunately the next set of visitors are coming soon, so we must switch out with the other group. But we will definitely give you homage as thanks!

**Femilia:** I'm looking forward to it.

_\[The instances start leaving Femilia's shoulder. They slowly disperse.\]_

**Transcribed Message:** It was nice talking, Ms. Femilia! Let's meet each other again!

**Femilia:** I'll come back again!

_\[The instances fully disperse.\]_

Shortly after the check-up was instigated, a letter from a sender with the pen name "Lights in the sky" had been mailed to the Foundation. A bag of capsules filled with bioluminescent ink alongside what seemed to be a "thank you letter" were dedicated towards the Foundation researcher Femilia Raynes.

_Hello again Ms. Femilia!_

_Thank you again for helping our home, we appreciate it greatly!_

_Hopefully you'll accept this capsules of our ink as a homage!_  
_We hope to see you in the future!_

_— Your friends, Lights in the sky._
