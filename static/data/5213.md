##### **Special Containment Procedures**:

The known entrance to SCP-5213 has been disguised as a construction site for an ongoing series of extensive pipeline restorations. Additionally, at least three members of STF Lambda-19 ("The Midwives") are stationed on site at all times disguised as construction workers.

The entirety of the Parisian sewage pipeline system is to be routinely checked for any buildup of SCP-5213-related biological contaminants. In the event of such buildup, the impacted section is to be secured and cleared by members of Lambda-19.

Additionally, all sewage pipelines that run through or are connected to the Catacombs underneath Paris have had their flow redirected through Biological Containment Site-91.

The Catacombs of Paris have been closed indefinitely under Cover Story SD-1 ("Structural Degradation") in order to facilitate investigation of the extent of the tunnel network connected to SCP-5213.

* * *

##### **Description**:

SCP-5213 is the designation given to a Catholic church discovered in the depths of the Catacombs of Paris. The structure appears to have been constructed as early as the 12th century, as many elements of the structure are indicative of the French Gothic style that was dominant at the time.

SCP-5213 is located within a region of the Catacombs that consists of numerous mining tunnels known as the mines of Paris. These tunnels were originally used to quarry large amounts of limestone which was used to build the city and its surrounding conurbations. SCP-5213 itself is constructed from the same limestone. This system of mining tunnels evolved to become the municipal ossuary[1](javascript:;) that constitutes the Catacombs of Paris.

The structure is roughly 60m tall and adorned with many of the features typical of Gothic architecture including flying buttresses, a spired tower, a nave, various stained glass windows, and three galleries. It is unknown how the structure was built so deep underground while maintaining such accuracy.

Documentation recovered from within the structure indicates it was inhabited during the French Revolution by a group known only as _La Fleur Sanglante_; research is on-going to ascertain its connections to the Neo-Sarkic cult known as the _[Société de la Fleur Sanglante](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3862)_.

### **Attached Addenda**

##### **Discovery**:

SCP-5213 was discovered on the 13th April, 2020, by a group of three sewage workers conducting routine maintenance on the Paris sewage system. Sewage workers are frequently required to prevent sewage from entering the Catacombs.

The sewage workers were trapped within SCP-5213 for an entire day. Two of them disappeared within the structure, prompting Martial Danglard, aged 23, to attempt to escape the structure. He was found emerging from a sewage access manhole ranting about "a church buried in the earth" and was apprehended by local Gendarmerie[2](javascript:;).

* * *

**Date**: 14th April, 2020  
**Interviewer**: Dr. Victoria Takemi, Junior Researcher, Department of Theology  
**Interviewee**: Martial Danglard, Municipal Sewage Maintenance

* * *

**Foreword**: _Dr. Victoria Takemi ordered Martial Danglard to be relocated to Provisional Site-1786, a field research centre established in the Catacombs, for further interrogation concerning his experiences with the anomaly._

* * *

**\[Begin Interview\]**

**Dr. Victoria Takemi**: Have a seat, Mr. Danglard, I'm sorry for your treatment by the local Gendarmerie but I suppose you're familiar with their … usual methods? Please, excuse my poor French.

**Martial Danglard**: Martial, not Danglard. You're not with the RG[3](javascript:;), are you? I'm not in trouble?

**Dr. Takemi**: No, not at all. I'm with a separate, unaffiliated organisation that deals with anomalous phenomenon. I'd like you to tell me about the structure that you discovered.

**Martial**: The church? I already explained that to the Gendarmerie. Just ask them about it. I don't want to talk about it again, please.

**Dr. Takemi**: Martial, I'm not the Gendarmerie. I'm not going to arrest you for finding something that you could never understand. How about we begin with the discovery?

**Martial**: There was a.. uh.. a ruptured pipe.. brown chunks of shit all over the floor. D-do we have to continue?

**Dr. Takemi**: Where was the ruptured pipe located?

**Martial**: Sub-Layer Three, beneath Sub-Layer Two.

**Dr. Takemi**: Did you notice anything weird about this particular pipe?

**Martial**: It wasn't normal sewage. It was thicker and smelt like rotten meat. It was d-disgusting.

**Dr. Takemi**: How old would you estimate this particular pipe was?

**Martial**: Old, really old. It was rusted shut apart from the.. oh god, the stench.

**Dr. Takemi**: How did this ruptured pipeline lead to the the discovery of the structure?

**Martial**: J-Jean was examining the damage to the pipeline when he saw the tunnels.

**Dr. Takemi**: And this space held the structure? Did you explore the aforementioned structure?

**Martial**: Y-yes.

**Dr. Takemi**: The Gendermarie said this was when you first lost a member of your crew, is that correct?

**Martial**: We hadn't even realised! A-Auguste had just disappeared without a word!

**Dr. Takemi**: Stay calm, Martial. What happened afterwards?

**Martial**: I-I collapsed by the w-wall.. and Jean went running i-in.. a-and the screaming - it never ended!

**Dr. Takemi**: That would explain why the Gendermarie apprehended you.

**Martial**: I ran and ran and ran. I'm so scared, D-doctor.. what's going to happen? Y-you'll find them, right?

**Dr. Takemi**: I have something to ease that anxiety, if you'd like to just come with me and give a statement to my superior.

**\[End Interview\]**

* * *

**Closing statement**: Martial Danglard was administered Class-E amnestics. Dr. Takemi took several samples from the ruptured pipe at Sub-Layer Three and conducted chemical analysis on the samples. Test results concluded that the samples consisted of menstrual blood and menstrual mucosa. MTF Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats") were requested to explore SCP-5213.

* * *

##### **Addendum 5213.1 - Recovered Documentation**:

During MTF Zeta-9's exploration of SCP-5213 and the surrounding subterranean environment, several text documents were recovered from both locations.

The first group was a series of journal entries by Francois Manchette de Lille, a Noble of the Gown and Chancellor-General of Paris. He was tasked with overseeing financial matters within the capital for King Louis XVI.

He was one of many members of the aristocracy who was condemned by the National Constituent Assembly. He disappeared from the country in January, 1793.

21st January, 1793

  
The King is dead, and all of France weeps.  
  
He was butchered in the streets by a group of peasants and lower-class merchants who clamoured for the blood of the ones who had wronged them so badly. If only they had opened their eyes and seen who had been the ones manipulating them all along. That traitor Robespierre and his thrice-damned Jacobins.  
  
My fellow nobles and I barely managed to escape their clutches and only achieved such by the virtues of a grand man, Charles Jacques-Alexandre, a sculptor and artist of great reputation within the palace of Versailles.  
  
He told us of a secret shaft behind the palace's hunting grounds, through which we "could find shelter and habitation to wait out the reign of terror that would begin under that demon Robespierre".  
  
We took the shaft in darkness, taking the children and women with us, descending into a grim, dark, and damp series of tunnels that stretched on much like an underground citadel built by some giant insects. Candlelight and our sense of touch were our only guidelines and so we carefully navigated our way throughout, hand in hand, until we came across it: the shelter that Jacques-Alexandre spoke of.  
  
A gigantic cathedral buried deep in the ground. "A guiding beacon from God himself." shouted one of the young gentry. I agreed in earnest, though I fear we did not speak of the same deity.

28th January, 1793

  
I must detail all that has happened since we entered the Cathedral of Sainte Saarn[4](javascript:;). May this candle burn bright enough and long enough for such to be done.  
  
On the first few days, we were happy and rejoiced, especially those of us who were members of the true faith. We sang to our Sainte and hoped that she would reward us for our faith and determination in the face of adversity. The others, Catholics and Protestants likely, grouped together and shared what little food their servants had carried down with them.  
  
I had found myself a seat at the base of the altar which featured a christ-like man being impaled upon a cross, his entrails scattered beneath him. Atop the altar itself was a grand statue wrought of a soft, pale, plaster of a young girl garbed in rags.  
  
I fed on scraps and the rats and insects that crawled amongst the cobbled floors, whilst gathering moisture from a rag that I had suspended in the vestry. It was a humble existence, but I was amongst the faithful and that would prove fortuitous.  
  
On the fifth day, the first young one died, a young, sickly, child that died at her mother's breast. After that, another died, a young boy, scarcely five years old. I took my fellow faithful few aside and we discussed the prospects. Their corpses were discarded in the corner, and soon that pile turned to a heap.  
  
Today, I write, for I have found an ancient text buried amongst relics and detritus. Its surface feels much like skin and its words are written in faded red lettering. I can understand the words without reading them.  
  
We must shepherd the flesh.

31st January, 1793

  
A few of the faithful and I continue to explore the tunnels in the depths of this grand cathedral while my text serves as a guiding companion, leading us to greater truths and delivering us from the falsehoods of the unfaithful.  
  
They protested against us when we set out to explore our habitation. They protested against us once we arrived and the faithful decreed myself as the Kadza[5](javascript:;) of our group. They protested against us once we gave them a cure for the hunger that gnawed at their stomachs.  
  
The faithful debate whether we should be rid of them. I suggest we keep them since we have enough to sustain ourselves for now. Our explorations of the tunnels, meanwhile, have born fruit, and the sacred text continues to whisper words of sweet rapture.  
  
It whispers of a place called Adytum, where men sculpted flesh and crafted the most beautiful women on earth. Each man was a king, and each woman was a member of his harem. Their union bore the most cherubine children. It sings soft songs of a man who unified the tribes of humanity and wore a crown upon his head, accompanied by a bandaged sage, a Herculean giant, a lover and wife, and a young, barefooted child.  
  
But it also whispers another soft song of a being, swollen and distended, with an infinite maw. The Mother of Creation, the Womb of Chaos. A fever dream overtook me upon this revelation and I dreamed of a being beyond myself.  
  
We must cultivate the flesh.

3rd March, 1793

  
Our work is done. I have set the faithful, those that consented and those that did not, to task. They took the unfaithful with them and began sculpting the heretics into a more suitable form for their tasks.  
  
Some will stand sentinel at our Mother's cradle, others shall roam the tunnels, forever serving to protect her shrine from defilement.  
  
All flesh, all blood, all will become one. Our rebirth is nigh.

  
The second document was a large, incomplete tome constructed of human skin with the text written in menstrual blood. It was written in several different languages that were translated by Dr. Victoria Takemi with assistance from Dr. Isabelle Beaumont, of the Department of Anthropology.

The text is titled "Apocrypha of Attila the Watcher" and appears to date to the Late Bronze Age, detailing the history of the region that would later become France.

 [+ Analysis of Apocrypha of Attila the Watcher](javascript:;)

 [- Analysis of Apocrypha of Attila the Watcher](javascript:;)

**Overview**:  
The text (if it can even be described as such) is the workings of a figure calling himself "Attila the Watcher", an itinerant preacher figure who wandered across much of Eurasia during the 13th century BCE. Beaumont has speculated that this figure is partially responsible for the Sarkic Diaspora in Europe that occurred just before the end of the Deathless Empire.

Apocrypha of Attila the Watcher is composed into several _sone_[6](javascript:;) that detail his various prophecies and messages. In particular, he focuses on themes of Theophagy and "Shepherding the Flesh". I speculate that his preachings dwell on these themes due to them being particularly powerful messages within the Nälkä creed that would re-inspire confidence among those Ancient Sarkics still in hiding.

Attila's apocryphal historical preachings end abruptly in **XIV: _Sone Naelma_**, which details his discovery of a Sarkic ritual ground that he praises as the _Omphalos_. This is speculated to be the location that SCP-5213 was built upon.

The text is severely stained and damaged by an unknown source of organic liquid matter and as such, I could only analyse the readable fragments of the text which concerned **XIV: _Sone Naelma_**.

**XIV: _Sone Naelma_**:  
After the death of our holiest Lord, the Ozi̮rmok, I wandered the West for decades. The people of the West are uncivilised and brutish, detestable in their practices. They burn the corporeal and holy flesh from their fallen ancestors and relatives, take these ashes and scatter them inside earthenware, burying them deep below the earth.

Such profane and sacrilegious practices are anathema to the truth that the Ozi̮rmok's insight left us with. I spoke to their multitude of leaders, both the mundane and the spiritual, guiding them towards the acceptance of the truth, of divinity, of the Nälkä.

Some accepted my words. Though my fleshcrafting was weak and largely ineffective, it was enough of a miracle. Removing the diseased flesh of the sons and daughters of local lords, healing the dying, and bestowing gifts upon the worthy. Through my actions and words, I developed a following, a great flock that followed me throughout the barbarous lands of the West, where flesh was rejected and the sinful flocked in droves.

We came upon the _Omphalos_, the navel of the whole world, and I knew it to be the place that God had first walked upon this Earth. I felt a presence beyond that of the Grand Karcist's and set my followers to work building the greatest and grandest shrine: a place of rest for the Važjuma so that the _ousia_[7](javascript:;) cannot flee. A temple to trap a fragment of her physical essence. And thus, I remembered the greatest _sone_ that the Grand Karcist himself ever uttered:

"_The body is a temple and a prison: a temple for the flesh, and a prison for the soul. All things return to the Abyss of Chaos, for we are born of flesh and soul. It is her divine presence that causes all things to wither and die. Fear the Old God and her children above all._"

##### **Addendum 5213.2 - Exploration Log 5213**:

**Video Log 5213**

* * *

**Locale:** SCP-5213, Paris, France

**Personnel:** _MTF Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats") were assigned to explore SCP-5213. Their mission directive was to locate SCP-5213, recover pertinent documents or artefacts from within SCP-5213, and finally, discover the status of the two missing civilians. The following video comes from the feed recorded by Zeta-9-3's helmet mounted camera._

* * *

**\[Begin Log\]**

Video feed begins. Zeta-9 can be seen slowly approaching the entrance to SCP-5213 that was discovered by Martial Danglard. Z-9-1 gestures towards the broken pipeline and small crawlspace located under it. Z-9-2 seals her respirator and takes a sample of the viscous, brown-coloured liquid that is flowing from the pipeline as several chunks fall out of the pipe.

Z-9-1 lays prone and slowly shuffles beneath the pipe, followed by the other two members of Zeta-9. They emerge into a singular tunnel with SCP-5213 at the end of it. Z-9-3 flicks the safety off of her Ruger SR-556 and turns the rifle-mounted laser sight on as the rest of the team do the same.

Zeta-9 approach the structure. Z-9-2 approaches a stained glass window and peers into it, raising her rifle as she does. The three members discuss the various entrances that they can use to access the structure. Z-9-2 notices movement within the structure and prepares to fire her rifle; Z-9-1 and Z-9-3 take similar positions beside her but see nothing.

Z-9-1 approaches the wooden doors at the front of the structure and takes out a breaching tool, placing the flat end against the door and pulling swiftly back towards her. The wood splinters into chunks on the first attempt. The second attempt creates a fist-sized hole in the door. Z-9-1 gestures to Z-9-3 and together they raise the rusted iron bar that held the door sealed shut.

A swift kick from Z-9-1 opens the door, and Z-9-2 throws a flashbang grenade through a shattered window. Z-9-3 enters the structure and motions with her hand that the structure is clear. Z-9-3 begins exploring the structure, panning her camera to reveal a heap of children's bodies located beneath the altar. A large book, later identified as "Apocrypha of Attila the Watcher", is located on the altar, its pages open and heavily stained with an unknown substance.

Z-9-1 grabs hold of Z-9-3 and pulls her hastily backwards, causing her to stumble to the floor. Her camera pans up to the ceiling to reveal several dark-red tentaculoid entities[8](javascript:;) that coil and contract their appendages towards the floor. Z-9-2 gestures to approach her window and the pair move slowly over to her.

Zeta-9 discuss neutralising the entities and agree that they're likely to react if they approach the altar. Z-9-1 gives Z-9-2 the all-clear to utilise one of the thermobaric grenades clipped to her belt. Z-9-2 preps the grenade as Z-9-1 and Z-9-3 take cover outside the structure. The resultant shock wave damages the structure but neutralises the entities which collapse to the floor of SCP-5213.

Z-9-3 fumbles around the altar and removes the large text, causing the altar's top to slowly slide backwards and onto the floor. Z-9-3 requests the clearance to explore the new structure which is granted by Z-9-1 who is struggling to bag one of the dead tentaculoid entities.

Z-9-3 descends a small staircase that was concealed within the false top of the altar and turns her night-vision goggles on. Her camera adjusts to night-vision automatically. The space consists of a tight corridor with a low roof. Z-9-3 begins to shuffle and crawl through the space, dropping her rifle behind her and drawing her sidearm as she slowly navigates the cramped space.

Her eyes scan the environment and her breathing becomes noticeable panicked as she continues to crawl through the chamber. Wet dripping noises can be heard above her head as droplets periodically slap against the camera lens, slightly obfuscating the camera's view.

Z-9-3 emerges into a large, central chamber containing a corpse clutching a sheaf of paper in one arm. She looks upwards into the central chamber and her camera pans around to reveal \[REDACTED\] suspended from the ceiling.

###### **Continued from Exploration Log 5213**:

\[…\]

Z-9-3 emerges into a large, central chamber containing a corpse clutching a sheaf of paper in one arm. She looks upwards into the central chamber and her camera pans around to reveal a large, distended womb-like structure suspended from the ceiling.

Z-9-3 approaches the structure and pans her camera down to reveal a gigantic pool of brown liquid that is flowing directly into a deep pit. It is filled with the same brown liquid with chunks of flesh-like tissue suspended within it.

Suddenly, the structure throbs and writhes as it empties a large amount of viscera and tissue into the pit. The structure subsequently deflates in size.
