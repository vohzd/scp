**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4451 is to be stored in an anechoic chamber[1](javascript:;). A commercially produced bell muffler is to be placed into the interior of SCP-4551 when not in testing.

**Containment Update:** In order to control rust build-up, SCP-4551 is to be cleaned with a 20% electrolytic solution of white vinegar mixed with salt, once per day and re-cleaned after testing. This process is to be performed inside SCP-4551's anechoic chamber.

Furthermore, in order to prevent severe oxidation to occur on SCP-4551's surface, renaissance oil is to be doused daily. This oil is to be blessed by a member or decendent of Roseafar.

**Description:** SCP-4551 is an ornate iron funeral bell, constructed during the late 1300s in Roseafar, Scotland. When SCP-4551 is rung, it produces a clear note in E♭3, which causes an illusion (SCP-4551-1) to appear to the ringer for a period of up to ten minutes.[2](javascript:;)

SCP-4551-1 illusions appear to be incorporeal, partially-translucent figures with a physical appearance identical to a deceased individual whom the ringer had an interpersonal relationship with.

The following has been observed during interactions between a ringer and an SCP-4551-1 illusion:

*   The ringer maintains that the SCP-4551-1 illusion is the 'soul' of a deceased individual.

*   Ringers report that the SCP-4551-1 illusions converse about past memories shared between the ringer and SCP-4551-1.

*   SCP-4551-1 illusions engage in endearing behavior such as giving compliments and easung doubts when emotionally 'close' to the ringer, and engage in negative[3](javascript:;) behavior when 'distant' to the ringer.

**Update:** Rust has been documented occurring on SCP-4551, with about 3 mm2 of rust occuring daily, generally forming around the base of the bell. As of █/██/████, it has been discovered that when a human subject rings SCP-4551 while the object is rusted[4](javascript:;), a cognitohazard occurs in which the memory of a deceased individual is completely forgotten by the ringer. For more information, please see addendum no. 3. It is currently unknown what will occur if SCP-4551 is rung while fully rusted.

The _Prayer of Rosefar_, a holy book from the region, describes SCP-4551's rust effect in the following manner:

**Addendum No. 1: History and Recovery Information:**

SCP-4551 was originally discovered in Roseafar[7](javascript:;), Scotland, a secluded and autonomous village located near the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.

![20190421_011057.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4551/20190421_011057.jpg)

Roseafar, Scotland.

Originally a dead bell[8](javascript:;), SCP-4551 was used by citizens in the village, for religious ceremonies and festivals.

According to a senior member of Roseafar, Fr. George Albert, SCP-4551 was considered to be a holy item, and was used to wish for harvests and to celebrate and revere dead members of the community. A special ceremony known as the '_Gost of God'_ was conducted to remove rust from SCP-4551, and to prevent deceased members from being forgotten by the population of the village. This ceremony required a dying member of the community to baptize the bell. A special song was sung during the ceremony, viewable as a transcript below.

[Gost Of God' Transcript.](javascript:;)

[Close Text.](javascript:;)

_Maen, caome send sae aend sell dead maen Shael liea, whean that comaes based and baerre, era have noathing wean we away faed, well tha t we cares foare is worams, Escaeot flat which we dka for God's sake, wea have naothing ready but God's Goetz and a latest memy._[9](javascript:;)

Ghost' sightings and reports of paranormal activity were frequent in the area surrounding Roseafar, with the local area using the sightings as a method to attract tourism to the region. These sightings had not been taken seriously until April 9th, 2005, when, during a mass offered in Edinburgh for the recently deceased Catholic Pope John Paul II, SCP-4551 was rung, triggering the appearance of 23 instances of SCP-4551-1. The presiding priest, Roseafar native Fr. George Albert, confessed to removing SCP-4551 and moving it to Edinburgh for this mass.

Foundation agent Lilly Amarte confiscated SCP-4551 at the ceremony, and George Albert and the congregation were detained, and given class-A amnestics.

**Addendum No. 2: SCP-4551 Testing Log**

Five tests were conducted with SCP-4511, viewable below.

Currently, SCP-4551 summons SCP-4551-1 instances regardless of the ringer's place of birth.

D-1072 and her father discussed her childhood, and apologized for his lack of involvement with the family. D-1072's Father apologizes, with D-102 accepting, as both reconcile.

**Addendum No. 3: Rust Test**

As SCP-4551 produces a cognitohazardous effect when rung, testing has been been put forth to judge if SCP-4451 when rusted can act as a rudimentary amnestic. The following tests had been conducted by Dr. Amie Amarte and Dr. Lucy Daniels, tested on D-4515.

\[BEGIN LOG\]

**700 Hours:** _D-4515 is brought into SCP-4551's containment chamber._

**Dr. Daniels:** D-4515, before you ring SCP-4511, I have a few questions to ask you.

**D-4515:** Yes, Doctor.

**Dr. Daniels:** Good. First, where were you born?

**D-4515:** Hammersfield, Southwestern Wales.

**Dr. Daniels:** And your mother and father?

**D-4515:** Roseafar, Scotland.

**Dr. Amarte:** Do you have a family member, friend, or even pet that has died?

**D-4515:** My mother.

**Dr. Daniels:** Her name, D-4515?

**D-4515:** Yeah, her name is, or um, was Beatrice Saifield.

**Dr. Daniels:** (_to Dr. Amarte_) We have her on file?

**Dr. Amarte:** Yeah, we do. POI following the bust at Roseafar.

**Dr. Amarte:** Ring SCP-4551 for me, D-4515. Thank you.

**703 Hours:** _D-4515 rings SCP-4551 which produces a note of E♭3. Nothing appears during the duration of the ringing_.

**704 Hours:** _D-4515 is silent, along with Dr. Daniels and Dr. Amarte._

**Dr. Daniels:** D-4515, who is your father?

**D-4515:** Floyd Saifield.

**Dr. Daniels:** And who is your mother?

**D-4515:** I don't know, Doctor. I only know my father.

**710 Hours:** _Dr. Amarte holds a picture of Beatrice Saifield, D-4515's mother._

**Dr. Amarte:** Who is this to you?

**D-4515:** I don't know who that is, Doctor.

**Dr. Amarte:** Do you remember seeing this photo or face at all?

**D-4515:** I told you, no.

**Dr. Amarte:** Have you heard of Roseafar?

**D-4515:** Pardon?

**Dr. Amarte:** Oh, I see. One last question. Have you seen this bell before? _She holds up a picture of SCP-4551._

**D-4515:** No, I haven't. Never have I.

**Dr. Daniels:** I see, thank you D-4515. That is all.

\[END LOG\]

**UPDATE:** SCP-4551 behaves as a rudimentary amnestic, able to produce an effect in which the ringer will completely forget the memory of the individual summoned during a rusted ringing of SCP-4551. Family members and those related are not affected. Currently, the only long term side effect is clinical depression, and periods of muteness.

\[BEGIN LOG\]

**1200 Hours** _D-4515 is brought into interview room 361, meeting with Dr. Daniels, and Dr. Amarte._

**Dr. Daniels:** Please be seated. D-4515, we have a few questions to ask you.

**D-4515:** Yes.

**Dr. Amarte:** Good. Firstly, what do you see here? (_She holds up a photo of SCP-4551._)

**D-4515:** A bell, I guess. It looks old, very rusty.

**Dr. Amarte:** Do you remember seeing this object before at all?

**D-4515:** No.

**Dr. Parsy:** What is this to you? (_She holds up a picture of SCP-4551's Containment Chamber._)

**D-4515:** A room, but the walls are weird, lots of angles. Never seen it before.

**Dr. Amarte:** All right then, next question. Is your mother named Beatrice Saifield?

**D-4515:** No. I don't know who my mother was.

**Dr. Amarte:** Do you have a father?

**D-4515:** My father was named Floyd.

**Dr. Daniels:** Last question, who is this, to you? (_She holds up a picture of D-4515's mother._)

**D-4515:** I don't know who that is. I've never seen her.

**Dr. Amarte:** I see. That is all, D-4515. We will return you back to your cell.

\[END LOG\]

> Dr. Amarte's Note: _It was about a year or so since we conducted the test involving SCP-4551 and D-4515. The subject seems to have completely forgotten the memory of their own mother, not even able to recognize her from a photo. How frightning… We might be able to use SCP-4551 as an emergency amnestic, but the overall scope is going to be pretty limited. Might only be for Roseafar, but I don't know just yet. I don't think it occurs with a location or memory, just a person. And besides that, the after-effects may be too severe. Yet it’s not as though there aren’t just as many ethical issues with our standard source of amnestics… But is it //right_? I just feel a tinge guilty, erasing a man's memory from him. Imagine if the some old coot doctor done the same to me. If they made me forget her. Like I did with the man's mother. For now though.

> I'll put those feelings aside. I have to talk to Daniels.//

**Laura:** My mother was named Beatrice Siefield. A clergymember, from Scotland, Roseafar or something. I've never been, being born in the states, but I'd like to visit, after all, Scotland is-

**Dr. Amarte:** That's all we need to know. Is this her? (_Dr. Amarte holds up a photo of Laura Siefield's mother._)

**Laura:** Oh, yeah, that's her at right.

**Dr. Amarte:** Good. Last question, do you have a brother?
