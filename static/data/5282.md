SCP-5282-1 and SCP-5282-2, respectively.

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-5282-1 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. This cell must not exceed an area of 8m x 8m. SCP-5282-1 is not to exit the containment cell except during testing. SCP-5282-1 is to be provided with the following:

*   One plush doll. Subject is permitted to request a change.
*   One "LEGO Bricks & More - Creative Bucket," for recreational purposes.
*   Five coloring books of any brand. Books may be swapped at the request of subject.
*   One box of crayons, any brand.

SCP-5282-2 is to be kept in a standard anomalous item storage locker directly adjacent to SCP-5282-1's cell. SCP-5282-2's recall radius must encompass SCP-5282-1's cell at all times to prevent any unintended containment breaches.

Both SCP-5282-1 and -2 are currently housed at Site-17.

**Description:** SCP-5282-1 is a female of Western European descent, 105 cm tall, weighing 15.3 kg (~33.7 lbs). SCP-5282-1's apparent age is estimated to be four or five years, however, SCP-5282-1 has been in Foundation custody for several years without any notable change in appearance. SCP-5282-1 refers to itself as "Ava," and states that it does not know its last name.  
Little Ava and her beautiful toys,  
SCP-5282-2 is the collective designation given to a set of 50 wooden alphabet blocks, each measuring about one cubic inch in volume. Material analysis of SCP-5282-2 reveals no anomalous materials or structures.  
Wanted by all of the girls and the boys  
SCP-5282-2's primary anomalous effect manifests when SCP-5282-1 arranges a selection of SCP-5282-2 instances to spell out the name of a noun in the English language. When this takes place, the object described will appear within the general vicinity of SCP-5282-1 within approx. 5 seconds. SCP-5282-2 does not produce these objects, rather, the object is taken from where it was previously located and deposited near SCP-5282-1. The method of transportation is unknown, and is theorized to be anomalous in nature as well.  
The colorful letters  
SCP-5282-2's secondary anomalous effect occurs when SCP-5282-1 travels a certain distance away from a given SCP-5282-2 instance, which has been designated the "recall radius." This field is spherical in shape, and extends approx. 15m from each SCP-5282-2 instance. When SCP-5282-1 exits this radius, the given SCP-5282-2 instance will immediately appear within 1m of SCP-5282-1.  
Make everything better,  
**Discovery:**

SCP-5282-1 and -2 were recovered on ██/██/████. Prior to recovery, several news stations published articles regarding the sudden appearance of a fossilized _Tyrannosaurus rex_ skeleton at █████ █████ ███████ Daycare Center, in \[DATA REDACTED\], USA. Elsewhere, reports were made about the sudden disappearance of the same _Tyrannosaurus rex_ skeleton at the \[DATA REDACTED\] Museum of Natural Sciences. Upon investigation, SCP-5282-1 and -2 were found at the site of the appearance, bearing several other objects of unknown origin. The _Tyrannosaurus rex_ skeleton was returned, and amnestics properly distributed. SCP-5282-1's parents have not been identified, however, there is a possibility that \[DATA REDACTED\].  
Always spreading feelings of joy!

Test 5282-06

Spelled Word

"GOOD DOG"

Times Performed

One

Results

SCP-343, bearing the appearance of a Great Dane

Notes

_While this was intended to test whether SCP-5282-2 would cause things to appear based on SCP-5282-1's preference, a misspelling of the word "good" led to a minor containment breach. I am going to suggest that SCP-5282-1 be guided in the spelling of words via SCP-5282-2 from this point on to prevent any further unintended containment breaches. We're just lucky that this happened before we tried to spell "lizard" or something._ - Site Director Bryson
