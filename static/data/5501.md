###### **Special Containment Procedures**

  
SCP-5501 is contained within a full blackout containment vault at Provisional Site-166 along with all known instances of SCP-5501-1. This vault is suspended, via high-tension cables, in the center of a 120m diameter spherical cavity carved into the bedrock beneath Charleston, Nevada. It is of the utmost importance that no light in any spectrum be allowed to penetrate into this cavity.

At no point should any personnel enter the containment chamber surrounding SCP-5501. In the event of unauthorized access to the exclusion zone surrounding the facility, site security has been authorized to immediately respond with deadly force, up to and including initiation of Protocol Alpha Black.

Due to the highly volatile nature of SCP-5501, STF Tau-6 ("Those with No Name") has been created with the sole focus of keeping SCP-5501 and SCP-5501-1 instances contained. As such, Tau-6 Command has been pre-authorized to initiate Protocol Alpha Black without additional notice.

All records of the events of the 1864 Massacre at Seven Pines have been removed from all official and published documentation. An ongoing disinformation campaign to discredit any remaining references has been largely successful.

All testing into the nature of SCP-5501's anomalous properties has been permanently suspended under 05-Overseer Directive 5501.ORD.01.

**This will not be rescinded.**

T. Harding with non-anomalous camera. _c. 1860, Philadelphia, PA_

SCP-5501 is a bellows-type "wet plate" camera that belonged to Thomas A. Harding, a once-prominent photographer in the years leading up to the American Civil War. The case shows significant signs of wear of the kind expected to be found on cameras of this type utilized during the war.

The camera differs significantly from all other known types of similar cameras in that the bulky lens housing is encased in thin strips of a previously unknown beryllium bronze alloy completely fused to the wooden structure of the housing and lens casing. The wood itself appears to be fashioned out of a single continuous piece, showing no seams or signs of adhesion.

At the top of the housing is a small slot for the introduction of the plates utilized to capture images. These plates are also of an unknown alloy, but due to the nature of the content stored on the plates, it is impossible to ascertain their exact composition.

There are patches of heavy staining along the front and right side of the camera's housing. Spectral analysis of collected samples indicate that this staining is from a fluid similar to human blood, but containing various enzyme indicators that corresponds with no known phenotypes or haplogroups. Of additional note, the blood carries certain markers which indicate the presence of variegate porphyria.[1](javascript:;)

SCP-5501-1 collectively refers to 18 individual photographs taken by SCP-5501. These plates resemble those made utilizing a process known as "collodion wet plate photography".

### **Attached Addenda**

###### **Discovery**

  
SCP-5501 and SCP-5501-1 were recovered in the aftermath of an incident that occurred during the decommissioning of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in May, 1994. An unmarked containment cell had been located in one of the Asylum's sub-basements. Upon examination, SCP-5501, a lock-box containing SCP-5501-1, and several journals were discovered along with the corpse of an unnamed individual later identified in Asylum documentation as Patient 65-2953 - T. Harding.

**Incident Video Log Transcript**  
**Date:** 1994/05/03 @ 21:02  
**Action Team:** MTF Omega-88 ("The Oathkeepers")[2](javascript:;), MTF Sigma-66 ("Steel Veil")[3](javascript:;)  
**Operational directive:** Contain outbreak & control information leakage  
**Team Lead(s):** Dir. Ruslav Diaghilev; Lt. Maj. George Hartfield; Lt. Maj. Elia Montserrat

**Foreward:** _The outbreak at the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum has been ongoing for approximately 9 hours, and remains localized to the facility. Due to the decommissioning of the Asylum, the majority of the facility has been abandoned and is only a limited risk of information leakage. Foundation assets on-site have cordoned off the area, and initial cover story Epsilon Omicron 5 ("Gas Leak") has been disseminated to local law enforcement._

_Omega-88 has been selected due to their expertise in dealing with alchemical anomalies. They have been directed to enter Trans-Allegheny & attempt to contain the outbreak, with Sigma-66 standing by in external support._

* * *

\[BEGIN LOG\]

<_Both MTF teams have assembled in front of the asylum, standing a little apart from each other. Dir. Diaghilev steps to the fore and turns to face them. Camera feed is from the point of view of Maj. Hartfield._\>

**Diaghilev:** Ladies and gentlemen. We are facing what might be a full incursion into our world by forces that are utilizing alchemical processes. As such, Sigma-66 will remain outside unless their aid is absolutely necessary. Major Montserrat, your primary responsibility should be the safety and security of the surrounding civilians. Is that clear?

**Montserrat:** Yes, sir.

**Diaghilev:** _Otlichno_. Hartfield, stay close. I will do what I can to nullify the effects of-

<_Diaghilev is interrupted by the sound of shattering glass and an extended shriek as someone plummets from the top floor to slam into the ground not far from the assembled teams. Both teams react, crouching to a guard position, weapons raised. After a few moments of stillness, Montserrat directs one of her subordinates to examine the victim._\>

**Hartfield:** So, I guess they know we are here.

**Diaghilev:** That would be a safe assumption, Major. They knew when I stepped out of the helicopter.

<_The agent sent to examine the victim returns shaking his head and says something to Montserrat that is out of audio pickup range._\>

**Montserrat:** Be careful in there, gentlemen. We'll keep a lid on things out here.

<_Omega-88 moves up the steps to the door, where they stand to the side as Diaghilev steps forward to lightly place his fingertips against the wood. After a few moments, he nods to Hartfield as he steps aside. Hartfield steps up and pushes the door open, stepping aside to allow three of his team to enter. Diaghilev follows, with Hartfield and the remainder of Omega-88 following after._\>

**Harris:** Fucking Christ…

**Hartfield:** Stow it, Harris. Walker & Reid, take point. Harris, Gaudreau, & Barnes with me. Welles & Izraz, you're with the Director.

<_The camera pans around the room as Hartfield steps further into the lobby. Arrayed along both walls of the entrance hall are the crucified remains of 16 members of the hospital staff. Each of them have been stripped naked, blinded, and have had their tongues nailed to the center of their forehead._\>

**Gaudreau:** What the fuck? Anyone got any ideas about the tongue thing?

**Hartfield:** Director, what are we dealing with?

<_Diaghilev crosses over to the nearest of the crucified staff members, then almost immediately recoils as the person suddenly groans and flexes feebly._\>

**Diaghilev:** _Kakogo chyorta!_ Major, they are all still alive.

<_He steps forward again, this time placing the tips of his fingers against the victim's forehead, to either side of the attached appendage. After a few moments, he steps away in disgust._\>

**Diaghilev:** Even if I could do something for so many, this one is already far too gone for it to matter. They did all this to themselves.

<_He closes his eyes and draws forth his crozier into his right hand. He begins to mutter something in an incomprehensible language, and all of the crucified staff sag into their restraints._\>

**Diaghilev:** Major, please. Give to them _usypleniye_. I have taken their pain for the moment.

**\[Several minutes omitted for brevity\]**

**Hartfield:** Point, go. Director, reports indicate that the outbreak should be down there, in the sub-basement. Some unmarked cell.

<_The camera angle shifts towards the dark opening to a stairwell leading down. The lights in this area have all completely failed, and the area is lit with dim torso lamps and the tactical lights mounted on the agents' weapons._

_Agents Walker & Reid take point and head down the stairs, quickly disappearing from view._\>

**Hartfield:** <_After two minutes of silence_\> Point team, report.

<_Two more minutes of silence._\>

**Hartfield:** Damnit. Director, please stay here. Harris, Gaudreau, Barnes.

<_Hartfield steps forward and slowly descends into the darkness. After 18 steps, the stairwell makes an abrupt turn and descends another 18 steps to end in what looks like a doorway opening into large open room._\>

**Hartfield:** Director, I'm about to leave the stairwell. I will give the all clear when- Harris! Step back!

<_The view swings sharply around, the dim torso lamp illuminating the face of Agent Harris, a glazed look in his eyes as he pushes past Hartfield and walks woodenly down into the room._\>

**Harris:** Can't you hear it, Major? Someone's callin' fa' help. S'gotta be th'others.

**Hartfield:** Damnit, Harris. I said step back!

<_Hartfield attempts to grab Agent Harris, but the agent wriggles free and walks out into the room, disappearing from view._\>

**Diaghilev:** Major, there is tremendous energy emanating from below you. I'm coming down, your team isn't equipped for this.

<_Hartfield curses, then steps to the side as Diaghilev brushes past him on the stairwell. After a few heartbeats, he follows out into the room_\>

\[Report trimmed to prevent redundancy\]

The room at the bottom of the stairwell had been a large storage area, though what it was before that I am uncertain. What is obvious is that in the clearing out of the room, hospital staff found an unmarked containment cell which had apparently been sealed shut some time ago.

The door had obviously been forced open, and the room beyond showed signs of having been disturbed. Inside lay the remains of some poor soul that had obviously been alive when they had been sealed into the room. I can only imagine what horrible crime they must have committed in order to be subjected to immurement, but I would rather not.

Whoever sealed that person in had also sealed in an ancient camera along with a lock box full of plates presumably taken by that camera. The plates are what I have determined to be the source of the outbreak. At some point during their investigation, someone opened the lock box and exposed the plates inside to the light.

The images captured on those plates are not of this world, and yet are. It is my guess that the creator of this camera devised a way to create a sort of double exposure, capturing an image of something in this world, overlaid by an image of that terrible city we know as Alagadda. This is not the worst of it, I fear.

As the plates are exposed to light, they continue to develop, and the image of Alagadda draws ever clearer. This has the result of radically thinning the barrier between that world and our own, causing portions of our reality to become subsumed by portions of the other.

I fear that I am uncertain as to how far this has progressed, but of what I am certain is that these plates must never be allowed to fully develop. Doing so would allow free travel between this world and that. It is bad enough that the occasional visitor from that vile place finds their way here, but if the Ambassador were to step over into this world? I know not what calamity would befall us.

It was in clearing this room that I lost the majority of the Oathkeepers that were sent with me. I regret their loss, I should have realized the nature of the incursion before I allowed them to head down without my direct intervention. The responsibility for their loss lies squarely upon myself. Major Hartfield did everything he could to save them, but the wards that failed to safeguard their minds were my own.

What is clear is that you should look not to the College for a savior. The consequences of the Great Seal are such that, and it pains me to admit this, my colleagues and I are no longer up to the task of safeguarding our world from this evil in addition to the greater one we have locked away.

\-Ruslav Diaghilev,  
Director, The Foundation Alchemy Department

Despite the loss of the MTF Omega-88 team sent with him, Director Diaghilev was able to secure SCP-5501 & SCP-5501-1. At his request, Provisional Site-166 was set up underneath Charleston, Nevada, a census-designated ghost town.

Additionally, Protocol Alpha Black was created and instituted throughout all Foundation assets, and Special Task Force Tau-6 ("Those with No Name") was created and assigned exclusively to safeguard SCP-5501 & SCP-5501-1.

Journal recovered with SCP-5501

According to records recovered from the US National Archives, Thomas Albert Harding was employed by Andrew Gardner in November of 1861, and was subsequently sent as a battlefield photographer to the Army of the Potomac under General George McClellan.

Originally assigned to photograph the aftermath of several significant battlefields, Harding was eventually transferred to the hospital staff of the Army of the Potomac and spent the remainder of his time principally cataloging wounded and dying service men. It is during this time that Harding came into contact with Dr. Franz von Leiber, supposedly[4](javascript:;) a surgeon assigned to the Medical Corps general staff.

According to the recovered journal of Thomas Harding, the two of them became close colleagues and worked together in Harding's effort to catalog the ongoing conflict.

September 19, 1862 -  
  
As the rebs pushed to Antietam, I thought we were done for. I'd never seen the general so down onto himself, pacing his tent like a man possessed of some evil spirit. I could tell that choosing not to support Pope at Bull Run really weyed heavily upon the man, and I am gladdened that such decisions do not fall to one such as I.  
  
Even so, Antietam changed much about the shape of this conflict. Lee escaped retribution, and for two dayes we chased stragglers from his armies. The toll at Antietam was tremendous, and Gardner sent me to the tents to capture the struggle of the medics and surgeons as they laboured to save the wounded and the dying. Never have I seen such suffering, and I fear that the things that I saw will forever plague my dreams.  
  
I came upon a surgeon, Dr. von Leiber. He had a curious way about him, as he walked through the tents, gore spatter'd. He would stop at a patient and would touch him at various places about his body, head, chest, stomach, groin, foot. He did not seem to mind the injuries, it was as if he was looking for something else.  
  
I took several plates of him at work, and Gardner liked them a great deal. He went to McClellan and had me permanently transferred to the tents. Wants me to keep capturing the "valiant struggle of man and surgeon" to keep our men active and protecting our waye of life. He was quite adamant, despite my distaste at being surrounded so by such unpleasant truths.  
  
I guess we must all accept such things in this daye. War, itself, is unpleasant.

September 29, 1862 -  
  
The aftermath of Antietam still haunts us. We still founde a multitude of the dead and dying all throughout the lands, and we could save only a fewe. Dr. von Leiber has been a constaint boone companion through these troubled tyms, and I have more than once thanked him deeply for his conversation. We both lay worke ourselves to thee bone each daye, only to lye awake in the night, unable to sleep for the dreams.  
  
von Leiber speakes of mysteries, things beyond my kin, tho i am a man of learning. Never afore had i heard such things from tutor or teacher, and i am intrigued. He speakes of "rubedo", and the power of the blood, as if 'twere more than just the vitae of our life, the humerous follyes(?) and that the strength I feare i know little of such things. i shall endeavour to speak more to him of such on the morrow.

The journal continues for several weeks, with Harding begining to view von Leiber as more and more of a mentor & trusted confidant. At first, Harding merely shows mild curiosity at the lessons von Leiber attempts to teach, but the disastrous events of First Fredricksberg clearly had a traumatic effect on Harding's mental state, and this break is clearly evident in the style and nature of the remainder of the journal entries.

December 16, 1862 -  
  
i know not what was in that foole Burnside's head.  
  
i was with the Right Grand Division, an' we had to fight our waye over the river, cros'ng with naught but a leaky boat 'neath our feete. 'twas nearly a massacre if not fore the brayve fooles of Col. Hall. they went 'cross in pontoons, 'n nearlye died to the guns of the reb sharpshooters.  
  
'n that 'twas only the beginning.  
  
when we got to the other side, 'twas a massacre, 'n the soldyers were more like animals then men. i feare i shall carry the shaym of what i saw until i carry no more.  
  
three days ago, 'twas bitt'rly colde, an the fog clung to us so we could barely see ourselves. to fight under such was disastrous, and still we marched. Burnside ordered an attack on Marye's Heights, 'n 'twas trully a massacre then.  
  
so much blood, 'n it got worse. so many wound'd 'n left 'pon the field. when that reb taught us mercye, von Leiber an' i went to the field. death surround'd us. 'pon all sides. i shook, but i captured much.  
  
'twas on the night of the 14th, that i witness'd the Miracle. von Leiber was 'xhausted, but 'twas filled with a mania that i right understood. so many lay afield, an' there wasn't anything to do.  
  
but he knewe. an' he did… something. he walked out onto the field, 'an he did unspeakable things. i swear t'it, he was not alown, but there with him, as he moved, 'twas a figure. wrapp'd all about in fabric, thin unto skeletal, with long'd fingers that 'twoud trail through the blood 'n the dyin'.  
  
it touch'd the bodyes, as von Leiber had done afore, 'n the bodyes respon'd. they moved throu' the dying, an' left behind the dead. gave 'em mercye, not like our own'd done. not like Burnside'd let.

Aftermath of the Battle of Marye Heights. _c. 1862, Fredericksburg, VA_

From the entries after, it becomes clear that Harding began to take a much more ardent approach to the instruction given to him by von Leiber. The majority of the journal is filled with illegible notes on the lessons given by von Leiber, as well as lengthy diatribes about death and Harding's growing fascination with the subject.

In the early summer of 1864, the notations in Harding's journal become significantly clearer, and all seem to focus upon the completion of an "apparatus" that he had been constructing under the tutelage of von Leiber.

June 24, 1864 -  
  
at last! the apparatus has been complet'd! von Leiber has been instrumental in allowing fore this dreem to com into being. without his guyd'nce, such a feate woulde not have been possible. i am forever in his debt.  
  
he telles me that a "great sacrifice" must be completed in order for the device to truly function. He has a plan to create such a thing, and even nowe, i have only just return'd from my meeting with Pleasants[5](javascript:;) about devising a tactik that will end this stalemayt, but also will empower my apparatus! he will take credit, of course, but i care not, for i must be prepayred for other things.

July 29, 1864 -  
  
all is in readyness. on the morrow, the works under Elliott's Salient have been dug. fore the past six nights, i have slept little, as von Leiber and i have traversed the darkness underneathe to draw the glyphes in the loam and dirt. eache of the supports and all the barrels of powder have beene mark'd with the Script, and all lies readye.  
  
the colored regiment should know to march around, but the whites in their hubris have not bothered to train. it only tooke pointing out to that pompous burnside that the colored needed training, whereas his whites would not. i have no regrets in what i am sure will be a bloodye daye, for 'twill bee forgotten in the aftermath of my great worke!  
  
tomorrow shall see both the fall of the enemye's defenses, and the rise of my most glorious greate worke and forever i shall[6](javascript:;)

  
On July 30th, 1864, the Union Army detonated a massive amount of explosive material that had been placed in a shaft dug underneath the Confederate fort known as Eliott's Salient. The ensuing explosion resulted in a large number of Confederate casualties and the creation of a significant breach in the east flank of the defenses outside of Petersburg.

A last-minute diversion in the order of battle saw that the regiment of US Colored Troops under the command of Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero were replaced with the untrained 1st Division under Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie. This catastrophic decision led to the loss of a majority of Ledlie's men as they marched straight into the crater created by the explosion and were ill-equipped to scale the other side.

Confederate sharpshooters were able to successfully pin down the majority of the 1st Division long enough for reinforcements to arrive and slaughter both the 1st Division and the forces sent in to support them. General Ulysses Grant would later write about the engagement, saying "It was the saddest affair I have witnessed in the war."[7](javascript:;)

The aftermath of the Battle of the Crater and the Siege of Petersburg is accounted elsewhere. T. Harding was listed as a casualty of the conflict and his name was printed in a catalog of the missing in a report from General Grant to the US Congress on August 16, 1864.

On August 14, 1864, during the battle of Second Deep Bottom, a small detachment of cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. David McMurtrie Gregg was sent to secure the railroad station at Fair Oaks. They never arrived, as they were attacked by "unknown forces" in what was recorded as the Massacre at Seven Pines.

All records of this event were purged due to the intervention of operatives from the American Secure Containment Initiative, a precursor organization to the Foundation.

**Item Number:** 65-2953

**Classification Type:** Human/Potentially Threatening

**ASCI Protocols for Containment:** Phenomenon 65-2953 must be secured at all times with a physical restraint garment commonly referred to as a straightjacket. It is currently housed at the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, where it shall be immured until deceased. Under no circumstances shall 65-2953 be allowed access to 65-2953A or the associated photographic plates.

All active information concerning Phenomenon 65-2953 is to be contained in a safe-box stored at the Warden’s office, along with all other discovered intelligence concerning the phenomenon, as per the directive noted below.

**Description:** Phenomenon 65-2953 is a white male, approximately 39 years of age, once known as Thomas A. Harding. The extensive madness brought on by the trauma of the war have left this Phenomenon with little coherency.

**Nota Bene:** Phenomenon 65-2953 was apprehended after the events of the Massacre at Seven Pines, during which it utilized 2953A to take a series of photographs of inhuman slaughter perpetuated by an unknown entity. These photographs have been stored in a locked case, and they are not to be reviewed under any circumstance.

**Disciplinary History:** On September 13, 1865, after being subject to immurement for a period of 367 days, Phenomenon 65-2953 vocalized a series of statements in an unknown language in apparent conversation with an unobserved entity. After several minutes of this, it lapsed into silence for approximately 34 minutes, then it began shrieking incoherently that it had been abandoned by a "Doctor von Leiber". These vocalizations ceased abruptly after approximately 22 minutes. An hour later, Phenomenon 65-2953 was declared deceased.

As per direct order from General Grant, Phenomenon 65-2953 and all related documentation will be sealed _in situ_, where they will remain until forgotten.

In the event of an uncontrolled containment breach, the commanding officer of STF Tau-6 ("Those with No Name"), or any surviving member, is pre-authorized to detonate the on-site nuclear device with no additional notice.

Upon detonation of this device, all Foundation sites will be immediately placed under Condition Alpha Black ("Imminent Breach-of-Veil"), and all assets will be notified to prepare for the imminent onset of a HK-class Deific Subjugation Scenario.

Under Condition Alpha Black, the SCP Foundation is authorized to assume immediate control of all available military assets, regardless of prior disposition, and proceed to assume a war footing in preparation for an imminent incursion into the Prime Reality of hostile outside forces.

It is understood that this will likely only serve as a delaying tactic, as there are currently no known ways to effectively combat an intrusion by Alagaddan assets into our reality.

May the gods have mercy on us all, for we have failed utterly.
