**Item #:** SCP-1253

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Omicron-19 ('_Flash Lightning_') is currently assigned to the tracking, observation and recovery of SCP-1253-1 instances. All exposed subjects are monitored for correlations, all witnesses are administered Class-C amnestics and all compromising media is destroyed.

Recovered SCP-1253-1 instances are stored in humanoid containment units, which are secured with digital combination locks. Access codes to SCP-1253-1 instances are shuffled on a bi-monthly basis and distributed to associated researchers, Site Security and Site Command. SCP-1253-1 testing is conducted with the notification of Site Director Davis.

**Description:** SCP-1253 is a phenomenon affecting various cities in Bolivia and Peru. In the event of war, famine, or the death of a prominent political leader, SCP-1253-1 instances will progress from an unknown origin point to the affected cities.

SCP-1253-1 instances are sapient automatons, capable of conversing in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Quechua. SCP-1253-1 instances are constructed of heavily decayed organic material, including entrails, limbs and genitalia. This material has been identified as originating from a variety of sources, including _Vicugna pacos_, or alpaca specimens. The anatomy of SCP-1253-1 instances is lacking in organs, musculature and skeletal structure, and it is currently unknown as to how instances retain autonomy. SCP-1253-1 instances also display various behavioural quirks including decorating themselves with feathers, bead bracelets and necklaces, carving various patterns onto themselves and objects, and conversing with themselves.

SCP-1253-1 instances will interact with subjects in the six to fifteen age range. Subjects will exhibit severely impaired judgement and be convinced by SCP-1253-1 instances to progress to the nearest high-altitude landform. SCP-1253-1 instances will there instruct subjects in a polytheistic religion bearing heavy similarity to the Quechuan religion. Instances will explain the structure of this religion, the procedures for various ceremonies, rituals and feast days, and demonstrate how to correctly conduct _Capacocha._

Subjects who have experienced SCP-1253 phenomenon appear to maintain various correlations. The majority of subjects demonstrate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, including paranoia and intrusive thoughts, as well as apparent sociopathy and criminal tendencies. A minority of subjects also claim membership to the 'Children of the Sun.' The existence of such an organisation has not been verified; there is some doubt to its existence.
