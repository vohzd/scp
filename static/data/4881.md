SCP-4881 prior to Foundation acquisition.

**Item #:** SCP-4881  
  
**Object Class:** Safe  
  
**Special Containment Procedures:** A perimeter around SCP-4881 has been established to prevent unauthorised access. Civilians are permitted to access SCP-4881 if they are under its influence. Methods of reversing SCP-4881's anomalous effects are ongoing.

Testing with D-Class personnel is forbidden. All SCP-4881 test subject pairs must volunteer, and must be content with experiencing SCP-4881's effects for the remainder of their lives.  
  
**Description:** SCP-4881 is a probabilistic anomaly originating from a _Salix babylonica_[1](javascript:;) tree. If two individuals enter beneath the canopy of SCP-4881 while maintaining physical contact[2](javascript:;) and, without leaving the canopy, engrave their initials into SCP-4881 by penetrating the outer layer of bark, the two will never experience separation from one another for a duration greater than one year.

More specifically, upon the day of SCP-4881's first catkin formation every year, a situation will arise where both individuals will inevitably meet; no actions taken to date have succeeded in separating the two.

In the event that one of the two individuals die, SCP-4881 itself will take their place. The remaining individual will therefore return to SCP-4881 annually.
