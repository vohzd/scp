AIC.WARHAMMER Readout, Site-121, 2013-05-29 Hotspot Begins 13:59:00

**Item #:** SCP-5222

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the latent abilities of people and things under the SCP-5222 designation or any sub-designations thereof, containment chambers shall be highly reinforced against pressure waves and, if facilities permit, entropy set to minimum[1](javascript:;). If entropy is not adjustable at the current site of the contained entities, please make arrangements with your site director to relocate the entities to a variable-entropy site via BOUNCE.

Any reports of ruggedly handsome men in sunglasses walking away from fiery explosions in slow motion should be cross-checked against GOI-2666.

**Description:** SCP-5222 is a collective designation for people (sub-designation α) and objects (sub-designation β) associated with Lord Explosion's Pyrotechnic Playground and Daycare[2](javascript:;), a Type-16 Pocket Dimension[3](javascript:;) and Multi-Tenant Conceptual Mindscape[4](javascript:;). There are currently 26 different SCP-5222-α entities catalogued, and none contained. There are currently 1326 different SCP-5222-β items catalogued, and none contained.

**Discovery:** SCP-5222 was provisionally created by AIC.COLOSSUS[5](javascript:;) on 2013-05-29 after Site-121 went offline with no [SCUTTLE](/scuttle)[6](javascript:;) heartbeat[7](javascript:;), which correlated to a concurrent spike[8](javascript:;) in anomalous background entropy per AIC.WARHAMMER[9](javascript:;).

The nature of the spike and rapid return to baseline did not match any known emissions signatures, and was determined with high confidence to be a Ruhiel-class Transitory Phenomenon[10](javascript:;). MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down")[11](javascript:;) was scrambled to the area per SCUTTLE Dead Man's Switch Protocol.

> **Area-14 Command**: Explor— Major, you are _in a pocket dimension._ We just needed to confirm the site didn't pop and leak. You need to get out of there, do you want to get fucking stuck in Lord Explosion's Pyrotechnic Playground or whatever it is forever?

Uh…okay, this may not be the right one, there's nothing going back to 1388, but this Dave apparently gets up to some weird shit so, maybe? Pocket dimensions and all, that matches. Says he claims to have…invented Thursday? Had a big cover-up operation that Damn Feds had to do after Bearpuncher Solutions appeared on the NASDAQ selling Service as a Service. If this _is_ your guy, he's got a shitload of brothers, too. So, some kind of Type Green with an explosion school.

Let's see here, we've got Explosionology, Explosionography, History of Explosions, Explosion Appreciation, Theoretical Explosions, Lil' Sploder's Daycare…why's there a fucking daycare? Uh, then we've got Applied Explosions, this one just says Explosions but in big all-caps letters, Walking Away From Explosions In Slow-Motion, Team-Based Holistic Exploding Leadership, Expl—

> **Ν-7-β-1 (Maj. L. Swain)**: You're probably right, command. We'll stack up and see.

[\- Addendum 5222-2](javascript:;)

After two weeks of reports from MTF Nu-7's Beta and Gamma teams, entropy levels localized around the perimeter of the traversable discrete dimension began to slowly increase again, indicating destabilization of the Transitory Phenomenon. Despite this transitory period taking roughly three days, and the relative location of the teams to the baseline world being traversable in only 20 minutes, both teams were lost. All 264 members are considered lost and have been awarded the Foundation Silver Star for Distinguished Service.
