An invitation email to join SCP-5553.

**Object Class:** Keter

**Secure Containment Procedures:** _New Procedures following the escape of D-7372:_ SCP-5553 remains uncontained at this time. However, Foundation personnel with Special Clearance PSM-1 are required to engage with SCP-5553 regularly each day from a non-Foundation personal computer, and file reports with External Affairs Team Sierra-611 in order to refer useful information obtained from SCP-5553 to local law enforcement agencies.

**Description:** SCP-5553 is a social media networking site called JACK, accessible from url https://jack.███. Its features include status posting, photo sharing, a news feed, public and private commenting, and direct private messaging. This site is only accessible to people who have committed serial murder of at least 3 victims.

Persons who are not eligible to view site content are exposed to an infohazard that causes confusion and memory loss related to the contents of the web page. In approximately 5% of cases, this effect is more severe, causing nearly-instantanious quadriplegia, intense pain, and subject death within 10 minutes, after which the device connected to SCP-5553 disconnects and shuts down. Premature shutdown of the device does not mitigate the lethal effect of the infohazard.

Invitations to join the site are sent via email to users with internet access who meet the above condition (Designated PSM-0). These emails are routed from the above (invalid) .███ domain but are otherwise non-anomalous.

Upon joining the site, PSM-0 users are allowed to utilize the site features. They can create a user profile under a pseudonym—or their real name if they so choose—and join discussion forums. These forums cover many topics related to homicide and other off-topic subject-matter. Several of these forums cater to specific interests, including support groups for users who want to reform or repent for past actions, and advice boards dedicated to sharing tips, tricks, and strategies to perform murders without being caught. The most popular board, the "Showcase", allows users to have their own individual page to act as a portfolio of past murders performed.

According to the site's "about" page, it was launched in 1999 by an entity under the pseudonym Moriarity. Reviews of ICANN[1](javascript:;) records have produced no evidence of such a domain being registered, as .███ is not a valid top-level domain. An attempt to force ICANN to create the .███ domain for Foundation use is in progress.

Can't fucking take this. I'm sitting here. it's been months and they haven't found her, they've called off the search and everything, and I still can't sleep. This happens every time. It doesn't matter how careful I am, I am always afraid I'm going to get caught.

When the matter of SCP-5553 was discussed with D-7372 by a Foundation operative posing as D-Class personnel, D-7372 admitted he had an account before his incarceration. D-7372 was transferred to Site-651 and interviewed by Foundation staff, D-7372 agreed to aid Foundation researchers in providing information about the contents of SCP-5553.

Testing log 3: Moriarity
------------------------

_D-7372 receives a private message from Moriarity. D-7372 states he has never spoken to Moriarity before. D-7372 is authorized to interact with Morarity and respond as instructed, while relaying the responses. The conversation as reported by D-7372 is as follows:_

**Moriarity**  
You were relatively active until recently. I was worried something had happened.

**RendInTwo**  
I got in trouble and had internet priviliges taken away.

**Moriarity**  
That's a shame. You were so good at supporting people wanting to reform.

**RendInTwo**  
Well, I don't want them to end up like me. But hey, why are you reaching out to me personally? I'm nobody.

**Moriarity**  
I don't think you're nobody. You're one of us. We need to look out for, and support, each other.

**RendInTwo**  
What other support can you provide?

_According to D-7372, Moriarity does not respond for about 20 minutes. Test is concluded._

72 hours after the end of the last test with D-7372, Site-651 suffered what appeared to be a non-anomalous security breach. D-7372, utilizing previously-unknown knowledge of Foundation security protocols, exited his holding cell, killed two Foundation personnel and successfully passed through 3 security checkpoints with unanticipated precision before escaping into the desert.

An investigation into the escape revealed several security flaws in both personnel and software protocols which were quickly remedied.

PSM-1-F was given access to screen recordings of D-7372's sessions interacting with SCP-5553. PSM-1-F reported that D-7372 had not been accurate or honest in the contents of the conversations with Moriarity. PSM-1-F reports the following conversation took place.

**Moriarity**  
I know where you are. I know who's holding you. It's alright, I'm here to help you. Tell them I said you were active until recently and was worried about your well-being. Ask them if you are allowed to converse with me. They will likely say yes, as it will be an opportunity for them to get information, and that tends to blind their common sense sometimes.

**RendInTwo**  
I got in trouble and had internet priviliges taken away.

**Moriarity**  
Good, you're back. I have spent the last day getting information for you. Let me know when you're ready. In the meantime, let them know that I replied with something polite, and that you were actively wanting people to reform. They don't need to know your real post history. Lol

**RendInTwo**  
Well, I don't want them to end up like me. But hey, why are you reaching out to me personally? I'm nobody.

**Moriarity**  
So we're clear: I am not doing this for free. You will work for me until the day you die. But you're going to be a free man, so there's that. Ready? Tell them I said something nice and polite.

**RendInTwo**  
What other support can you provide?

_At this point, Moriarity spent fifteen minutes explaining an intricate plan of escape utilizing classified documents and schematics, until the test ended._

_At the time of this writing, PSM-1 users report that D-7372's account is again actively posting._
