→ CAUTION ←
-----------

  
SCP-3911-1 emits high levels of latent Akiva Radiation. Be advised: under no circumstances should any adherents of an organization indicated in the Area-02 Religious Entities guidebook be assigned to SCP-3911.

SCP-3911-1 is contained in a reinforced object containment locker at Armed Reliquary Area-02. A Class-AR Scranton Reality Anchor[1](javascript:;) has been permanently affixed to the exterior of the locker, and should be checked monthly for technical integrity.

SCP-3911-2a & -2b are contained together within a standard biological containment locker in the same facility. In the event of a major containment breach of SCP-3911-1, it is believed that SCP-3911-2a & -2b will be the [obvious next targets for retrieval,](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lovataar-throne) despite the lack of any obvious anomalous properties. As such, these objects have been placed in a sealed containment vault in sublevel 32 of Area-02.

Specifics relating to a containment breach have been sealed under administrative order O5.ord.3911 and will be made available to Area-02 security in the event of a breach episode.

###### **Description**

![thorn.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3911/thorn.jpg)

SCP-3911-1 file photo

SCP-3911-1 is a 1.89 meter long shaft of bone decorated with ornate patterns. The method by which SCP-3911-1 has been shaped is assumed to have been carnomantic in nature, as there are no observable indications of tool use.

Analysis of the object suggests that it was grown from a single human bone, the specifics of which are unclear.[2](javascript:;) The latent Akivar rating of 6.02 manifests as significant modification to living tissue to such a degree that it makes physical examination of the object impossible.

SCP-3911-2 collectively refers to a long couch-styled divan[3](javascript:;) and footstool[4](javascript:;), both grown from human bone and inlaid with decorative glass. The cushion atop the divan appears to be made from a material that resembles cloth, though analysis of samples taken from the cloth indicates that it is woven from several different types of human hair & stitched together with stretched human sinew.

While neither of the SCP-3911-2 objects exhibit any anomalous properties aside from their construction, both are believed to have once belonged to the same entity that created SCP-3911-1 and were initially discovered together.

Both SCP-3911-1 and -2 display signs of extreme age and damage. Carbon dating of the SCP-3911-2 objects suggest that they originate at some point in the 13th-12th centuries BCE. Analysis of the DNA found within the -2 object contain only X-chromosomes, specifically from the mtDNA Haplogroup T subclade T1a. This suggests that the origin of SCP-3911 would likely be in the western Ural region of Siberia.[5](javascript:;)

SCP-3911-2a & -2b file photo

On October 21, 2019 a report was made from an asset within the Hellenic Police[6](javascript:;) that an unusual event had been logged by the field office on the island of Kythira, Greece. Representatives from the University of Sydney, Australia had filed a request for local law enforcement to do a check-in at one of their dig sites located in the south-east horn of the island.

The law enforcement officer sent to investigate also failed to report in, at which point the Foundation asset intervened to redirect the active response to the Foundation. RTF Omicron-22 ("Relic Hunters")[7](javascript:;) was activated and sent to investigate.

**Retrieval Event Video Transcript**  
**Date:** 2019/10/22 @ 21:02  
**Retrieval Team:** RTF Omicron-22 ("Relic Hunters")  
**Operational directive:** Explore & Retrieve  
**Team Lead:** Captain Dimitra Stratide, "Alpha"  
**Foreward:** _RTF Omicron-22 arrived at the site via helicopter. The site itself is made up of three prefabricated mobile trailers surrounding a shaft dug into the side of a rise. Two University of Sydney-labeled SUVs are parked near the buildings, and the police response SUV can be seen parked on the road. At the time of arrival, there were no signs of activity._

* * *

\[BEGIN LOG\]

_\[Primary feed is from Captain Stratide's helmet camera. The helicopter lands on the rise above the site, and the four person team deploys from there, descending rapidly into the site proper.\]_

**Alpha:** Keep your heads on a swivel, boys. We have precious little intel about this jaunt.

**Delta:** Heard, Cap. There ain't shit out here. I thought all of this stuff had been dug up long ago.

**Alpha:** People keep finding shit, so other people keep sending folks out here to dig it up.

**Beta:** Wasn't there some big battle here that the Foundation doesn't want anyone to know about?

**Alpha:** Yeah. That's why we got sent out with almost nothing to go on. Something happened here and the Broken God guys are real closed-mouth about it.

_\[The team splits into two groups before moving into the site proper, with Alpha & Delta heading towards the nearest of the trailers.\]_

**Alpha:** Go for breach.

_\[Delta opens the door and steps inside, heading left. Alpha's view follows, then she turns right and scans the interior.\]_

**Alpha:** Trailer one clear. Mostly crates and some poor schmuck's paperwork. No signs of recent activity.

**Beta:** Trailer two clear. Mess hall. No signs of activity here either, place is pretty clean.

_\[The team converges on the third trailer, with Alpha and Delta breaching.\]_

**Alpha:** Trailer three clear. It's a workspace of some sort. Couple of light tables and some dirt boxes.

**Beta:** Well, I guess that leaves the dig site. These things are never simple. For once I'd like to get sent in and everyone's just having a sit-down complaining about pay or something.

**Alpha:** The brass doesn't need to send in highly-trained asskickers to that kind of thing. Instead, we get the messy shit _you_ signed up for. And, since you asked so nicely, you get point.

_\[The team approaches the opening in the side of the ridge. The shaft angles down at a slight incline, with rough timber bracing the sides and ceiling of the shaft, with the glow of electric lights visible further in.\]_

**Beta:** Well, at least we have lights. Always nice to see what's trying to kill us.

_\[The team proceeds down the shaft, Beta leading with Alpha directly behind. Delta & Gamma follow, stepping carefully on the uneven surface.\]_

**Command:** The info we got from Sydney U indicates that the primary dig site is 120 meters or so into the hillside. At 80, you'll make a slight left to get around some obstruction. This site was apparently some sort of fortress that got buried two to three thousand years ago. We just got a dump from the Anthropology Department that says this place played a role in the Sarkic/Mekhanite war, so look out for mech works.

_\[The team halts at the bend in the tunnel, and the camera plays across a frieze that has been uncovered in the wall. The carving depicts what look like [several colossi](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2406) standing around an empty field\]_

**Alpha:** Uh, Command, are you seeing this? Why wasn't this site tagged by our own Anthro boys before now? This is clearly Mekhanite.

**Command:** It was. Foundation Archaeologists are scheduled to take over next month.

**Delta:** Well, that timetable's fucked now.

_\[The team moves past the frieze and deeper into the shaft. About 40 meters on, the shaft opens into what looks like a chamber. Delta pauses just before the opening and indicates something on the floor.\]_

**Delta:** Cap, looks like we have blood spatter.

**Gamma:** Hey, the Kant meter is going up like a Christmas tree. Showing heavy Hume fluctuation and a helluva lot of Akiva.

_\[Alpha taps Delta on the shoulder in acknowledgement and the team steps around the splash of dark mud in the floor to enter the room.\]_

**Delta:** Fuck me.

_\[The chamber is a wide, semicircular space, the central area dominated by a large dais, and the back wall made up of what looks like a collapsed section of the roof. Arrayed around the central dais are twelve slowly undulating organic masses.\]_

**Alpha:** Command, do you have any read on what we're looking at?

**Command:** Not yet. I've got a call in to get some of our Anthro people on the feed, but we got shunted to Dr. Low's assistant. We weren't expecting a Sarkic anomaly here after this long. Proceed with caution.

_\[Alpha gestures for the rest of the team to spread out as she passes Delta and steps into the room, following the right curve of the wall. As she does, she looks across to the central dais, where an unknown person can be seen reclining atop SCP-3911-2a, SCP-3911-1 held in one of its right hands._

_The figure's upper torso appears to have been radically altered, allowing for the presence of three additional sets of upper limbs, all but one of which rests upon her lap. Several ridges of exposed muscle can be seen alternating between three sets of additional breasts, all of which are engorged and dripping a viscous black fluid. The figure's face is upturned towards the construction light hanging from the ceiling and it continues to sit unmoving, its eyes closed.\]_

**Beta:** I… is that Chalmers?[8](javascript:;)

**Alpha:** I'm not certain. Her file didn't say anything about her being a cultist. Command?

**Command:** Negative. Alexandra.aic says that Elizabeth Chalmers has a near zero-percent chance to have any hidden Sarkic connections.

**Alpha:** Well, if that's Chalmers, she sure as fuck isn't just a goddamn student.

_\[Alpha gestures and Beta and Gamma move in towards the dais, their weapons trained on the figure seated there. As Gamma steps forward, he steps close to one of the masses on the floor and it emits an audible groan and shifts towards him.\]_

**Gamma:** _\[Stepping back, his weapon falling to point at the mass.\]_ Shit, this thing is a fucking _person._

_\[Alerted by the vocalization of the first mass, the other eleven masses begin to shift towards it and Gamma, muscle tissue moving underneath their skin. Beta can be seen looking down towards the mass nearest him before jumping back, his weapon leveled at it.\]_

**Beta:** This one has a face, Captain. I think it's a face, anyway. It opened an eye and fucking looked at me.

**Delta:** Heads up. Chalmers is active.

_\[Alpha swings her head up, bringing the Chalmers entity back into view. All four of its right hands are now gripping SCP-3911-1 and its head lolls towards Gamma. As its head tilts forward, a gush of black fluid spills from its mouth, slowly spreading across its warped chest.\]_

**Chalmers:** Help… me… I can't… I can't…

_\[Its top left hand extends out towards Gamma, its fingers trembling as it reaches towards him. At its vocalization, all twelve of the masses begin moaning and the muscles under their skin begin to cramp and contort in unison.\]_

**Alpha:** Command, you got anything for me yet? We're armed to take on mechs, not flesh-things.

**Command:** Retreat to the tunnel. We have another Omicron-22 team headed your way, ETA 13 minutes.

**Alpha:** Fucking heard. Boys, you heard the man. Back out slowly.

_\[As the team begins to back towards the entrance, the Chalmers entity emits a shriek that causes the twelve masses to freeze in place.\]_

**Chalmers:** No! Please, you gotta… you gotta help me! I can't… I CAN'T!

_\[The masses begin moving again at an accelerated pace, rapidly gaining on the four RTF operatives. Alpha gestures and the team opens fire on the masses, projectiles impacting against the flesh eliciting sprays of black ichor. The Chalmers entity shrieks again and the masses sprout tendrils of muscle tissue, which reach obscenely towards the team.\]_

**Alpha:** Fuck it, get out. Now. Command, bring a dig team, 'cause I'm blowing this freakshow.

_\[The team makes it to the doorway, still firing at the squirming masses. At the opening, the three other operatives move through it, with Alpha pausing long enough to pull two grenades from her harness.\]_

**Alpha:** Frag out. Make tracks, boyos.

_\[She pulls both pins and tosses the grenades into the middle of the room before turning and sprinting up the tunnel behind the others. Six seconds later a loud concussion momentarily disrupts the audio pickups, and a cloud of dust briefly obscures the camera feed before the team exits the tunnel.\]_

\[END LOG\]

* * *

**Afterword:** _The reinforcing Omicron-22 team arrived 12 minutes later and the combined units performed a thorough sweep of the area. No additional anomalous entities were located and there were no signs of any breach attempts from the dig shaft._

Additional teams were sent to the site and the entire area was closed to the public. The University of Sydney was notified that a structural failure at the site was the cause of the team's loss and that no bodies would be immediately forthcoming due to the ongoing investigation.

Over the next several weeks, the site was carefully excavated and the non-living bodies of thirteen individuals were sent to Biological Site-16 for processing. In addition to SCP-3911-1 and -2, several non-anomalous objects of art were removed and transported to the Department of History main office in Prague. A full list of the objects recovered from the dig site is available upon request.

SCP-3911-1 and -2 were transported to Area-02 due to the high levels of Akiva radiation emanating from SCP-3911-1. The Foundation convoy carrying SCP-3911 was attacked en-route by members of [GoI-0432 ("The Hunter's Black Lodge")](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2408), a criminal organization with ties to the Russian Mafia and a known [Neo-Sarkic](http://www.scp-wiki.net/sarkicism-hub) cult. How they were able to acquire information on the transport and its whereabouts is currently under investigation.

SCP-3911 was initially transported by ship to Bergen, Norway where it was transferred to an armored convoy for the remainder of the transit to Area-02. The convoy transited safely into Sweden near Flötningen, where the attack took place.

**Transport Assault Video Transcript**  
**Date:** 2019/10/29  
**Transport Team:** MTF Xi-8 ("The Last to Fall")  
**Operational directive:** Transport SCP-3911 to Area-02  
**Team Lead:** Major Arkades Petralia, "Alpha-1"  
**Foreward:** _The initial stages of this action have been omitted for brevity. The assaulting force attacked the convoy at night, utilizing the surrounding trees as cover. They initially stopped the convoy by mining the highway, disabling the forward vehicle and damaging the roadway sufficiently to prevent forward escape._

_Over the course of the next 29 minutes the attacking forces destroyed or disabled all of the convoy vehicles while taking heavy casualties. Major Petralia was stationed in the central vehicle, and his camera shows the final stages of the assault._

* * *

\[BEGIN LOG\]

_\[Maj. Petralia is standing inside the cargo section of the central vehicle, and his view shifts from one of the gun ports looking north to one of the southern ones. As his view swings past the central cargo space, two black containment lockers can be seen secured to the floor of the cargo bay.\]_

**Alpha-1:** Bogeys to North and South. Vehicle four just went dark, so we are likely on our own. Let's show these bastards why we are the Last to Fucking Fall.

_\[The sound of gunfire can be heard across the communication channel as Maj. Petralia discharges his rifle through a gun port. As he continues firing, another explosion rocks the vehicle and he is thrown to the ground.\]_

**Alpha-4:** Major. Major! We gotta have someone against the back door, that last hit came from underneath.

_\[The Major climbs to his feet, then checks his firearm before changing clips.\]_

**Alpha-1:** Two and Six, you're first line. I don't care who comes through those doors, they won't be Foundation. Four, you're in the cab.

_\[A rapid staccato of bullet impacts reverberate through the inside of the cab as the attacking force renews their assault. Maj. Petralia leans against the wall of the armored container, waiting out the last of the fire before turning and discharging his weapon through the gun port. His shots are slow and deliberate, as he takes a breath to aim before gently squeezing the trigger.\]_

**Alpha-4:** Cab clear. Both drivers are dead, but one of them managed to hit the emergency seal. Radio is down in here too, but we're still getting a satellite download. Command is saying that air support is inbound, uhh should be 9 minutes out.

**Alpha-1:** Heard. Seal off from the cab. We-

**Alpha-4:** Major, we don't have time for that. Rear camera is operational and I see five, no six, incoming.

**Alpha-1:** Damn. Send the update to Command, but wait to get back here until after they breach. Who knows what they'll toss in at us.

**Alpha-4:** Yes sir. Uplink established, sending status-

_\[She is interrupted by another concussive shock as the back doors are blown inward. Alpha-2 is ripped apart by the blast, spraying the interior of the trailer with viscera. Alpha-6 opens fire into the darkness outside the door; his targets are out of range of the camera feed. The Major swaps out another clip, then ducks behind the cases containing SCP-3911. Shouting can be heard from outside the trailer in between the rapid-fire bursts from Alpha-6's assault rifle.\]_

**Alpha-4:** Uplink complete. Air support eta 8 minutes.

_\[The Major grunts in reply, then leans around the edge of the case just in time to see Alpha-6 fall to more gunfire.\]_

**Alpha-1:** We don't have 8 fucking minutes. Stay in the cab, four. Seal the rear access and stay put. This place is about to get real hot right quick and air will likely need eyes on the ground.

**Alpha-4:** Yes sir. It's been an honor.

**Alpha-1:** It's been something. Thank you.

_\[Voices can be heard speaking in Russian as two of the attackers climb into the rear of the trailer. The Major takes a deep breath, then swings to the side, firing four times in rapid succession and taking both attackers in the chest. He ducks back behind the case as answering gunfire peppers the wall in front of him._

_He takes another quick glance then jerks back as a bullet impacts the case directly in front of him. He curses and rolls to the other side, quickly firing four more rounds towards the back.\]_

**Alpha-1:** I can't fucking see them. Do you-

_\[He is interrupted as another explosion lifts him bodily from the floor and hurls him forward into the front wall of the trailer. He grunts in pain and slides to the floor. His camera angle shows the entirety of the trailer and the remains of the two cases containing SCP-3911._

_After 30 seconds, two figures in tactical gear climb into the truck, weapons raised. When no one fires on them, they separate, both moving to put several bullets into -2 and -6. A third figure climbs into the trailer and walks over to the cases. He pushes some of the debris out of the way, revealing SCP-3911-1.\]_

**Unknown 1:** Я нашёл Шип. Быстро отошли от грузовиков.[9](javascript:;)

_\[The other two figures can be seen pulling back and exiting the rear of the vehicle. The remaining figure sets aside his rifle and pulls both gloves free from his hands to drop on the floor. He glances back towards the rear of the trailer, then slowly reaches down and lifts SCP-3911-1 free of the debris._

_He immediately shrieks in pain as SCP-3911-1 appears to writhe in his hands. He falls to his knees, SCP-3911-1 clutched to his chest. Blood can be seen seeping from his palm onto SCP-3911-1._

_After 20 seconds, the figure looks up towards the front of the trailer.\]_

**Unknown 1:** _ŋämän cuca, utuua ŋetküce_[10](javascript:;)

_\[As the figure straightens, it lowers its hand clutching SCP-3911-1 to its side, and deep crimson ribbons of tissue can be seen running from the back of its hand and wrist down into SCP-3911-1. The ribbons intermittently ripple, as if something is passing through them from the figure into the staff._

_It steps over to the body of Alpha-6 and reaches down with its free hand to tear the combat vest clear of the body. SCP-3911-1 seems to flex again, and the figure kneels down beside the body to push the fingers of his left hand into Alpha-6's exposed upper torso. The skin and tissue of Alpha-6's chest and rib cage expands to run freely around the figure's hand before sliding up its wrist and underneath the cuff of its shirt._

_After 187 seconds, the figure stands, its exposed skin rippling and undulating as something moves beneath the surface. It looks back at the front of the trailer before turning and exiting through the rear.\]_

* * *

_\[The camera feed switches to an exterior camera mounted on the side of the convoy vehicle. The figure can just be seen at the edge of the frame where it collapses to the ground and screams. Two mounds of tissue sprout from its back over the shoulder blades and rip through its shirt and tactical vest. The two sprout into long, thin arms ending in a three-fingered claw tipped with 6 centimeter talons._

_The figure pushes itself back to its feet, using both SCP-3911-1 and its new limbs for balance. One of its companions approaches it from the side to offer assistance, obviously undeterred by the physical transformation. The entity snatches the other by the throat using one of its new limbs, the talons sinking deeply into the skin of his neck. The victim shrieks in pain and struggles only momentarily before the entity reaches over with his left hand and drags his palm across the man's face, taking the flesh and lower jaw with it.\]_

**Unknown 1:** _ŋämän cuca, jumnüta süve a. Tsatsa lüjekütake nälikäma._[11](javascript:;)

_\[The entity proceeds to consume its former companion much as it had consumed Alpha-6, the skin and muscle tissue melting away from its victim and flowing over the entity's exposed flesh. Additional ripples can be seen moving along the entity's face, and eight bone protrusions rip free of its head to form a coronet around the top portion of its skull.\]_

**Unknown 1:** _ŋämän cuca, sukanta juki a! matse sutä-_[12](javascript:;)

_\[The figure is interrupted by the arrival of three Foundation fast attack helicopters. All three of them immediately target the entity and it is consumed within a ring of explosive detonations. Two of the helicopters maintain a sustained fusillade of rocket fire at the entity, while the other circles to attack the surviving members of the assault force._

_The helicopters cease firing after 84 seconds when the secondary wave of fast troop transport helicopters arrive and deploy another three MTF Xi-8 squads.\]_

\[END LOG\]

* * *

**Afterword:** _The surviving members of GoI-0432 were cornered in a ravine less than a kilometer from the attack site, where the majority of them self-terminated. Deployed members of MTF Xi-8 were able to retrieve all three elements of SCP-3911 without issue, with SCP-3911-1 apparently unscathed by the attack. There was no trace of the unknown entity and it has been considered neutralized by the rocket fire._

The sole surviving GoI-0432 member was apprehended at the scene and was prevented from self-terminating by surviving members of Xi-8. He was transported the rest of the way to Area-02 with SCP-3911 where he was held for questioning.

**Yurievich:** Пошли в пизду твои химики.[15](javascript:;)

**Maj. Kiselev:** I can wait. Give it time.

_\[Major Kiselev proceeds to flip through the file on the table in front of him, ignoring the detainee. After 178 seconds, the detainee is noted to be showing signs of internal distress and is beginning to visibly perspire._

_After an additional 206 seconds, the detainee starts to shift erratically in his chair and to utter curses under his breath. After 316 seconds more, the detainee slumps in his chair, his face expressionless. At this point, Major Kiselev looks up from the file at the detainee and studies him for 3 seconds before closing the file.\]_

**Maj. Kiselev:** Thank you. I'm now going to ask you some questions about the raid where you were apprehended. How did you find out about it?

**Yurievich:** The Great Mothers told us to go, and we went. They told us to get the Thorn of God, nothing else mattered.

**Maj. Kiselev:** _\[Flips open the file and holds up a picture of SCP-3911-1\]_ This?

**Yurievich:** Yes. They didn't have a picture, just a drawing. From the _Valkzaron_.[16](javascript:;)

**Maj. Kiselev:** I see. Did they also tell you what it was?

**Yurievich:** Mother- _\[He struggles with the word, as if unable to speak. He frowns and continues to struggle, not breathing.\]_

**Maj. Kiselev:** Her name doesn't matter. Tell me what she said.

**Yurievich:** _\[He takes a ragged breath, looking relieved.\]_ She said that it was of the _Ozi̮rmok_,[17](javascript:;) and that we must retrieve it. To not come back if we failed.

**Maj. Kiselev:** That it was one of Ion's tools or weapons?

**Yurievich:** _\[He spits\]_ You are _koljatmertä_,[18](javascript:;) unfit to speak His Name.

**Maj. Kiselev:** Answer the question.

**Yurievich:** No, you fool. It was OF the _Ozi̮rmok_. It is His very Flesh.

**Maj. Kiselev:** Doesn't the _Valkzaron_ teach that Ion is no longer of this world?

**Yurievich:** _\[Coughs.\]_ Yours, maybe. The Mothers tell us that He is wai- _\[Coughs again, harder.\]_ That He is waiting. That He will return and-

_\[He coughs again, this time spewing several droplets of blood onto the table top. Major Kiselev gets up from the table and backs away.\]_

**Yurievich:** _\[After several more rounds of coughing.\]_ He will return and claim what is His.

**Afterword:** _Shortly after his final words, the detainee resumed coughing, spewing up a large quantity of blood and various pieces of viscera before expiring. An autopsy of the body later revealed an extensive infestation of previously-unrecorded 6.8cm-long organisms. These parasitic organisms had chewed their way into the detainee's left lung, where they began consuming the secondary and tertiary bronchi._

_At the time of the autopsy, the organisms had successfully consumed the entirety of the left bronchial structure and had begun to work their way up the trachea._
