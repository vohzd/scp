================

Object Class: Safe
==================

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4756 has been sealed within SCP-4756-1. Steel beams are to be bolted to the lid of SCP-4756-1 and the floor of its containment chamber.

**Description:** SCP-4756 is currently a large humanoid entity; multiple autopsies have shown that SCP-4756 only has two fully functioning organs, the heart and the brain, other organs are either non-functioning, heavily damaged, or missing. While animate, SCP-4756 will attempt to consume any and all human tissues it comes into contact with. Upon discovery, SCP-4756 was a mummified seven month old fetus, but SCP-4756 has since developed into multiple entities over the course of thirteen years.[1](javascript:;)

SCP-4756-1 is a stone coffin that has multiple thaumaturgical symbols engraved into it. SCP-4756 will heal wounds at a normal rate while stored within SCP-4756-1; however, SCP-4756 will rapidly regenerate damaged tissues in a matter of four to five hours while not stored within SCP-4756-1.[2](javascript:;) SCP-4756-1 has no anomalous properties outside of its relationship with SCP-4756. As of 01/12/2012 a small leather bound journal has been discovered in a hidden compartment on the inside of SCP-4756-1.[3](javascript:;)

After much traveling, I arrived in a small camp in the most secluded part of the woods. There's maybe forty people here, each adorned with strange tattoos and body paint. All except for Father, that is, the only markings Father has are that of grotesque scars going across the undersides of his forearms. When I asked why he only has those scars I only got a one word answer. Rebirth.

I will stay here for as long as I need to and not a day longer. I know it is likely that they don't actually possess the ability to cure me, but I can't risk missing out on being there for my family. I need to stay healthy for my new family, I need to do this for them.

Father approached me while I was studying Latin. I've made very little progress on learning Latin, only studying when Father forces me to. Father said that I needed to join the others in prayer, so I went to the center of the camp to join the others. All of them were chanting something in Latin, "Flesh of new(?), the grand ???, blessed are we for receiving your gift.", after this everyone was given a scrap of raw meat. I was told to eat, for if I didn't the prayer would be for naught. One small bite of that bloody meat, one small bite and I threw up. There was something about that meat that every fiber of my being rejected, hours after I was still vomiting. Father said that this needed to be fixed, and that I was learning Latin too slow for what was required of me.

I found the source of the meat last night, the very thought of what it was disturbs me to my core. They took his arm and his jaw, but he was still alive for some godforsaken reason. I saw the look of desperation in his eyes, he was praying to every god he knew for me to put him out of his misery. Before I could even think of what to do, Father found me. He gave me a lecture of how much I have disappointed him. I don't care about what this madman wanted from me anymore. Even if Father's group could help me, I refuse the very thought of it. When morning breaks I shall leave this camp and return to my wife.

Today is the day that my punishment is over. Chained to a wall, given nothing but human meat. Nothing to do but to read the holy scripts and learn Latin. For months, this was all I knew. Father has shown me the light, and for that I am grateful.

\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]

Father told me of what he wants to do. I shall serve my purpose to him, and I shall serve it well. I shall live for Father, I shall become as Father wanted me to, \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
I know the rites I must do. \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
Once these rites have been committed I will be ready for the ritual.

Father had told me of the components I need. A stone coffin, an open fire, \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\], \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\], and. My child. \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
The reason I wanted to stay alive is the one I must \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]. No, I must forget these thoughts. I shall not fail Father, I am his chosen, I will \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\].  
Only three days are left until the ritual must begin.

I've done it. The final component of the ritual is in my hands, but it comes at the cost of the only woman I've loved. It all happened so fast, I felt something primal awaken inside of me. One moment I was talking to her, the next I had grabbed a knife from the kitchen. I tackled her to the ground and I forced the knife through her ribs. Over and over again.  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
It wasn't until almost an hour had passed I had stopped. I carefully cut into her stomach, and tore it open. I saw him there, his skin was a dark grey. He died long before I finished. I carefully set him on the table, and did what I had to fulfill my hunger. \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
I didn't stop until all was left was bone. \[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]

I took him and wrapped him in what was left of his mother's dress. I took him to the ritual site, I had to prepare him before the ritual can begin.

\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
\[INFOHAZARD REDACTED\]  
Rebirth.
