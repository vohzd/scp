**Special Containment Procedures:** Protective steel chainlink fencing is to be placed around SCP-5416, with one access door secured with a high security padlock. Signage will indicate the fencing is for historical preservation. Keys are to be kept by an on-site Level 2 supervisor.

Once weekly, a Level 2 supervisor with a background in numismatics[1](javascript:;) will take an inventory of all items left on SCP-5416. Level 1 personnel will perform necessary maintenance and mowing inside the fencing. Level 1 personnel will hide any new coins of high value in the decorative urn near SCP-5416's statue, then add a circulated United States coin of any value on top of SCP-5416. This procedure is to deter attempts at theft.

Due to SCP-5416's public location and historic nature, removal of SCP-5416 has been deemed unnecessary for now. It is unclear what effect removal would have, and it would have to be carried out by properly trained D-class personnel.

**Description:** SCP-5416 is a circular mausoleum and grave monument on a raised knoll located near the center of █████████ Cemetery, outside of █████████, Louisiana. SCP-5416 was erected in 1889, and contains the remains of local philanthropist Michael Sofford and his wife Penelope Sofford. The mausoleum features decorative urns and a marble statue of a seated angel carved by Jason De Cannes[2](javascript:;). The statue carries a book inscribed with the quote: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."[3](javascript:;) The statue has been vandalized with the word 'mammon' carved into the angel's left foot.

Over 100 coins dating from the late 19th century onward are scattered upon the base of the mausoleum. A smaller amount of modern paper currency is also present. They show normal signs of deterioration due to weather and climate. A full inventory is available upon request from the on-site supervisor.

If a coin is removed from SCP-5416's base, the thief and any companions will be unable to leave the cemetery. They may not discover this immediately due to the cemetery's normal labyrinthian nature. Subjects report encountering endless mausoleums and monuments, in increasing states of overgrowth and disrepair. All grave monuments match the designs of other graves in the cemetery and surrounding area, repeating endlessly. The time of day ceases to change. Radio contact outside of the trapped group is no longer possible.

Outfitted expeditions have traveled three days from SCP-5416 after activating its effect without encountering any changes, other than witnessing centuries of disrepair and neglect on the graves and access roads. Aerial drones show a similar endless landscape.

SCP-5416's effect can be removed by replacing the stolen coin and adding any other piece of circulated currency to the collection on SCP-5416. Observers of SCP-5416 report noticing the subjects as if they had simply overlooked them up to that moment. Electronic surveillance shows static or other interference just before the subject's return. Companions separated from those returning the coin do not return and no recovery method has been found.

The use of drones to remove coins has resulted in their loss to the effect. Multiple groups suffering the effect have not been able to locate each other within the cemetery.

**Addendum-01, Discovery:** SCP-5416 may be tied to disappearances since as early as 1907. The Foundation became aware of SCP-5416 after █████████ Cemetery was featured on the paranormal investigation television series █████ █████████. The uptick in tourism and public interest in months following the broadcast resulted in several disappearances due to SCP-5416. The episode in question has been suppressed from further broadcast and distribution.

**Addendum-02, Crypt Exploration:** During an approved investigation of SCP-5416's crypt using penetrating radar, Researcher Wentworth discovered a hollow cavity in one wall behind a foundation stone. Removal of the stone revealed a leather and wood English-style suitcase. Suitcase contained a ivory-handled straight razor and $1,935 in tied bundles of five dollar banknotes. Banknotes were dated 1905, issued by the Merchants Bank of New Orleans[4](javascript:;).

Suitcase was returned to its location and pocket change was added to follow containment procedure. Further testing showed the banknotes and straight razor were subject to SCP-5416's effects. The crypt door has been secured and reinforced following this discovery.

**Foreward:** Handwritten note found inside SCP-5416's crypt. Paper was on the letterhead of the Chaparral Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana. Removal of the note did not trigger SCP-5416's effects. Ink and paper have no known anomalous properties.

**Transcription:**

I took travel money as we discussed. I'll see you soon in Lake Charles.

Sheridan[5](javascript:;), leave this. Some witchcraft is upon me. I cannot leave. I can walk forever in every cardinal direction but I cannot leave. Father's tomb might have been the perfect hiding place, but the angels or God or the Devil have other plans. There is only death here, endless graves. I have found not another soul my two days of wandering. I grow weak from thirst. I threw the money away and still I am here.

YOU GAVE AWAY ALL OUR FORTUNES, OLD MAN, BUT YOU JUDGE US FOR TAKING WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE. TO HELL WITH YOUR TRUSTS AND FUNDS AND ORPHANAGES AND GOOD WORKS! TO HELL!
