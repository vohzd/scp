Drawing of Sam Bodel approximately 3 days after initial containment.

**Special Containment Procedures:** A 600 meter metal perimeter has been established around SCP-5580. Personnel and recording devices are not to cross this barrier at any time. Neither SCP-5580 nor SCP-5580-1 is to be observed or recorded at any time. Recordings of SCP-5580 and of SCP-5580-1 are to be destroyed.

Should SCP-5580 de-manifest, Foundation Artificial Intelligence _Sato-6_ is to predict the locations where SCP-5580 will most likely re-manifest. These locations are to be surveilled remotely until SCP-5580 re-manifests, after which a 600 meter metal perimeter is to be re-established.

**Description:** SCP-5580 refers to a former army camp located within Death Valley National Park. Equipment found in SCP-5580 and used by SCP-5580's 62 soldiers was manufactured in the United States between 1951 and 1953[1](javascript:;). SCP-5580 soldiers (collectively referred to as SCP-5580-1) have been generally friendly towards Foundation staff, conversing and sharing meals with them during breaks.

SCP-5580 (and subsequently SCP-5580-1) will occasionally de-manifest. SCP-5580 will then re-manifest in a different location within Death Valley National Park approximately 4 days after de-manifesting. When unobserved, SCP-5580 will de-manifest after an unknown length of time estimated to be approximately 7-8 months (see Interview Log 5580-2). However, observations of SCP-5580 and SCP-5580-1 (both direct observations and recordings) can reduce this interval to under 2 weeks.

**<Begin Log>**

**Researcher Minh:** Can we ask you a couple of questions?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Sure. It'd be nice to talk to someone new.

**Researcher Minh:** Do you know what you're doing here?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Nah, I got no clue why I'm here. Ain't the first time, though.

**Researcher Minh:** It isn't?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** No sir. We were in this desert once before. I figured we were all ghosts, but I guess I was wrong.

**Researcher Minh:** Why would you think you were a ghost?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** We died. All of us. We were up past our helmets in sand when pop!

_(SCP-5580-1-S snaps)_

**SCP-5580-1-S:** All dead. And then again, pop!

_(SCP-5580-1-S snaps)_

**SCP-5580-1-S:** We're all here.

**Researcher Minh:** And why do you think that your… experience was death?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Well, I guess I can't say for sure that it was death. But everyone in the platoons agrees that we died. There's a certain feeling you get when your lungs give up. That's when you know you're dying. By the time you feel it, there ain't a single thing in the world that can save you.

**Researcher Minh:** You're saying that nothing can save you, and yet here you are.

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Us being here doesn't mean we got saved from anything. We still sink until we choke on dirt and sand, the only difference is that now we get to do it again and again. More chances to fail at clawing ourselves out before we die. There ain't no heaven or hell, just…

_(SCP-5580-1-S puts his palm up and then turns his hand over)_

**SCP-5580-1-S:** The top and the bottom. Always sinking, always choking. And we're always reset to back where we started.

**Researcher Minh:** What do you mean "reset"?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** There's this guy in my platoon, Eddie McKain[3](javascript:;). Some crazy kind of bug got him way back in Korea a couple of weeks before we all died for the first time. I'll tell ya, that guy was a mess! He was sweating all over, his right leg was swollen and red as hell. We all show up in the desert and Eddie's fine! It was like he never got bit. You cannot tell me that man wasn't somehow pulled back from death's door… reset.

**Researcher Minh:** Thank—

**SCP-5580-1-S:** It's not like he lost his memory or anything, the guy's body just went back to normal. At least, as normal as all of us can be in this whole mess.

**<END LOG>**

**Addendum 5580-1:** During the 5 months following initial containment, SCP-5580 de-manifested and re-manifested 11 times. The coordinates of each manifestation were entered into _Sato-6's_ database. Foundation staff have been spending considerably less time within SCP-5580, reporting feelings of discomfort and/or inhospitality from SCP-5580-1.

**Interviewer:** Researcher Minh  
**Interviewed:** SCP-5580 soldier self-identified as Sam Bodel, abbreviated to SCP-5580-1-S.

**Foreword:** Interview was transcribed from memory by Researcher Minh, Researcher Sovak, Researcher Webber, and Junior Researcher Ferrick. For this reason, it may contain inaccuracies.

* * *

**<BEGIN LOG>**

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Do you know why we keep dying?

**Researcher Minh:** We were actually about to ask you that. How often do you normally de-manifest?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Way less often than this. The first time we showed up in the desert we must have spent 7 or 8 months there. You guys showed up after we died a second time, which is also when thing really went off the rails. You're not part of this, are you?

**Researcher Minh:** Of course not. We're just as confused as you are.

**SCP-5580-1-S:** That's good. It's just that some of the guys have been saying that you're causing this, because we must have died about a dozen times since you first showed up. Funny thing is, we were running into guys in lab coats right around the time we died in Korea.

**Researcher Minh:** I find it hard to imagine that there's any sort of connection between us and some group of scientists in Korea.

**SCP-5580-1-S:** I never said there was one.

_(Nobody speaks for several seconds)_

**Researcher Minh:** What are you trying to say?

**SCP-5580-1-S:** We got a few brainiacs ourselves working in the platoons. Real smart guys, volunteered straight outta MIT. They're the ones we got trying to figure out why all this is happening. Once we realized everything we write gets erased when we die, the brainiacs started storing all the numbers in their head. I know they're gonna figure out why this is happening, but I guess I don't… I don't really know how long that's gonna take.

**Researcher Minh:** Well if it's any assurance, we also have lots of researchers trying to figure out why your camp keeps de-manifesting so frequently.

**SCP-5580-1-S:** Yeah, good luck with that. And just… try and watch your back when you're hanging around the camps. I don't want anybody getting hurt. Some of these guys are real zealots, ya know? Going around the camp, making people swear to keep fighting until there's one Korea, stuff like that. All vounteers. Meanwhile I'm just serving my 2 years[4](javascript:;).

**<REMAINDER OF INTERVIEW REMOVED FOR BREVITY>**  
**<END LOG>**

**Incident Log 5580-1:** On 24/7/2019, Junior Researcher Ferrick was followed by 3 SCP-5580-1 soldiers throughout SCP-5580. These soldiers harassed Junior Researcher Ferrick both verbally and physically; flicking lit cigarettes at Junior Researcher Ferrick and repeatedly asking him to follow them into a tent. The incident ended when a fourth SCP-5580-1 soldier escorted Junior Researcher Ferrick out of SCP-5580.

**Incident Log 5580-2:** On 3/8/2019, Senior Researcher Kevin Minh was assaulted by 3 SCP-5580-1 soldiers while walking through SCP-5580. Witnesses reported that the soldiers harassed Minh for several minutes before the attack, repeatedly threatening him and referring to him as a "murderer". When Senior Researcher Minh turned to leave SCP-5580, the 3 soldiers dragged him into a tent and physically assaulted him. The assault was ended by another group of SCP-5580-1 soldiers. Senior Researcher Minh was hospitalized in critical condition and has been put on medical leave until further notice.

**Note from Head Researcher Paresh:** What happened to Senior Researcher Kevin Minh is the result of our carelessness handling dangerous anomalies. The amount of unsupervised interaction with SCP-5580, an anomaly containing dozens of armed soldiers, is negligent, embarrassing, and unacceptable. I have submitted a request to triple the number of armed guards assigned to SCP-5580's containment site and elevated SCP-5580's risk class from "caution" to "danger".

Effective immediately, staff entering SCP-5580 must be accompanied by at least 2 armed guards. However, I would advise staff not to enter SCP-5580 at all. This is a dangerous and volatile anomaly, not a de facto breakroom.

> _Interview has been cancelled due to sudden change in circumstance and Foundation policy regarding interactions with SCP-5580-1._

**Addendum 5580-2:** During the 5 months following Incident 5580-2 and the subsequent change in staff policy, SCP-5580 de-manifested and re-manifested 4 times. The coordinates of each manifestation were entered into _Sato-6's_ database.

**Incident Log 5580-3:**

**Foreword:** In accordance with SCP-5580's containment procedures, the original recording of this incident was destroyed. The following incident log was recreated from first and second-hand sources. For this reason, it may contain inaccuracies.

* * *

**<BEGIN LOG>**

**<23:17>** SCP-5580-1 discharges multiple rifle rounds into the air. This action is repeated 4 times between 23:17 and 23:19[5](javascript:;).

**<23:19>** The following message is sent from SCP-5580 via a flashlight blinking in international morse code:

WE ARE DYING BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE. AS LONG AS YOU ARE HERE YOU WILL KILL US. LEAVE IN 12 HOURS OR WE WILL SHOOT TO PRESERVE OURSELVES. THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION.

**<23:38>** An emergency meeting between Head Researcher Paresh and all Senior Researchers assigned to SCP-5580 is held. During this meeting, a request for light armored vehicle support from [MTF Nu-7](http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#nu-7) is placed. This request is approved some time between 23:44 and 00:51.

**<23:41>** The following statement is sent from Head Researcher Paresh to all members of staff assigned to SCP-5580:

As some of you may be aware, the soldiers from SCP-5580 have threatened violence against us unless we leave within the next 12 hours. Despite their threats, we will maintain containment of SCP-5580.

Armored support from Hammer Down is on its way.  

— Head Researcher Paresh

**<01:06>** 6 armored trucks from MTF Nu-7 arrive at the containment site. The closest truck is parked approximately 50 meters away from SCP-5580, with its headlights powered on and pointed towards SCP-5580. A sniper rifle shot is discharged from within SCP-5580. It is unknown whether it was a warning shot or if it missed its target.

**<01:07>** Two sniper rifle shots are discharged from within SCP-5580, destroying the headlights on the closest armored truck.

**<01:08>** An order to power off all lights pointing towards SCP-5580 is issued by an unknown staff member. 5 more headlights are destroyed before the order is fully executed.

**<01:31>** All personnel are onboard armored trucks. An order to evacuate is issued, and all trucks depart from SCP-5580's containment site. An estimated $74,000 worth of non-essential equipment is either damaged or abandoned during the evacuation and has since been declared missing without chance of recovery. All temporary housing and office units at SCP-5580's containment site are abandoned.

**<01:59>** External sources confirm that the sniper rifles SCP-5580-1 is likely utilizing have an effective range of 600 meters. All armored trucks are parked on slightly elevated terrain[6](javascript:;) 600 meters northeast of SCP-5580.

**<02:17>** Evacuated personnel and equipment exit the armored trucks. Trucks are repositioned to form a barricade, blocking evacuated personnel from SCP-5580 sniper sightlines.

**<END LOG>**

**Addendum 5580-3:** Research on SCP-5580 has resumed. Analysis of SCP-5580 de-manifestations and observation of SCP-5580 has shown an inverse correlation between time spent observing SCP-5580 (and recordings of SCP-5580) and how long SCP-5580 persists before de-manifesting. To decrease the rate of de-manifestation, all existing recordings of SCP-5580 have been destroyed.

A ring of mesh fence and corrugated metal with an approximate 600 meter radius has been constructed around SCP-5580. This was done to prevent inadvertent observation of SCP-5580 and to shield personnel from SCP-5580 snipers.

Following Incident 5580-3, no attempts to communicate with SCP-5580-1 have been made.

During the 5 months following Incident 5580-3, no de-manifestations have occurred.
