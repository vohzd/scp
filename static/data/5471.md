**DATABASE ID:** SCP-5471

**Anomaly Class:** Safe-supernus

**Containment Status:** Uncontained/Uncontainable

**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-5471 is public knowledge;[1](javascript:;) due to its distance from local galactic space and the minor nature of its informational effects, the Extrasolar Activities Division considers cover-up efforts unnecessary. Monitoring of [Ortothan](/second-hytoth-hub) groups under Operation TETRAD UNLIGHT is to continue with an additional focus on behavior regarding the "Holy Sixth" of Ortothan mythology.

_They Imprinted Our Light,_ an attempted reproduction of SCP-5471 by Ortothan artist Onus SKY//QQQ-LAMPREY 7.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-5471 is a cognitohazardous region of space 20 megaparsecs (Mpc) from the Southern Local Supervoid,[2](javascript:;) 96 Mpc from Sol. The anomaly's dimensions — presuming it corresponds to a physical or metaphysical structure — are unknown.

When directly observed with appropriate astronomical equipment,[3](javascript:;) SCP-5471 implants a data packet into the observer's mind. This contains the following:

*   Information for baseline visuals on SCP-5471.

*   A concrete thoughtform message with eidetic recall.

The baseline visuals are mapped to the anatomy of the observer's species; in humans, this produces imagery of a six-digit hand, severed at the wrist with blood trailing across a perceived span of 47 Mpc. Imagery for other species matches their respective appendages and vital fluids, if applicable.[4](javascript:;)

The thoughtform message is mapped to the observer's primary language. While the exact mechanics behind this process are undetermined, tests have found that the message is legible and considered "deserving of remembrance" by all observers, regardless of their ability to interpret its contents.

Based on the reactions of Ortothan mythology adherents, this is in reference to Yorun-leusan, the sixth of seven gods tasked with protecting reality from extrauniversal threats.[6](javascript:;) As Yorun-leusan purportedly died in 2000 _Anno Terra_,[7](javascript:;) it is unclear how light from the anomaly has reached Sol so soon. Alongside the message contents, subjects claim to see sparks of light from inside the Southern Local Supervoid, as well as hearing "teeth clanging against metal" when they consider it. The Astronomy Department has detected massive bursts of ultra-high-energy gamma rays from the Supervoid.

Currently, the creator of the anomaly is unverified.
