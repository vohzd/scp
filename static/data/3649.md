Earliest archived photograph of SCP-3649.

**Item #:** SCP-3649

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Project SKYSCRAPER-31 is to develop methods for the penetration of SCP-3649. Project SKYSCRAPER-32 is to determine the feasibility of alternative means of terrestrial evacuation. Project SKYSCRAPER-33 is to devise a broad range of social preservation and containment contingency plans for the failure of all other SKYSCRAPER projects.

_19 iterations of SCP-3649 Special Containment Procedures have been archived and hidden._

**Description:** SCP-3649 is an altostratus undulatus cloud formation that maintains a static position relative to the Earth's surface. All electromagnetic waves and physical matter that pass through SCP-3649 are disrupted to varying extents, ranging from general degradation of radio signals to complete collapse of molecular structures. Collisions between SCP-3649 and mundane clouds result in the former subsuming the mass of the latter.[1](javascript:;) Certain types of clouds motivate notably larger growth than others following this integration process (cumulonimbus variants in particular.) No precipitation has been recorded originating from within SCP-3649.
