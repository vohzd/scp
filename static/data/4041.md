An SCP-4041 event in progress.

**Item #:** SCP-4041

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The DYNASTY Protocol is currently in effect, and is to be maintained indefinitely. Birds injured by SCP-4041-1 are to be explained under the cover story of predatory birds consuming toxic materials. Civilians witnessing or interacting with SCP-4041-1 are to be amnesticized.

The DYNASTY Protocol is as follows:

*   Complete infiltration of the paleontology field by Foundation personnel.
*   Surrounding planned and current paleontological dig sites, both [anomalous](/scp-4003) and nonanomalous, with anti-avian measures prior to excavation.
*   Widespread declaration that the theory suggesting that birds evolved from dinosaurs is obsolete.
*   Use of memetic agents embedded in educational media to reinforce that birds and dinosaurs are unrelated, and that no dinosaurs ever possessed feathers.

**Description:** SCP-4041 is a phenomenon involving anomalous coordinated behavior among various species of birds.

SCP-4041 events begin as ordinary flocks. The flock will stay close to the ground, often generating large clouds of dust or dirt. High-speed cameras trained on SCP-4041 events have detected small groups of birds within the flock attaching their wingtips together to form rings before dispersing again in a very short burst of light. Observation of SCP-4041 events has not shown any inherent pattern in these lights.

Excavation of the ground beneath SCP-4041 events will often (~70%) uncover various dinosaur fossils. Rarely, this will occur even in locations previously shown to have been completely excavated for fossils. Fossils discovered after SCP-4041 events are always of theropod dinosaurs, often coelurosaurians[1](javascript:;). The variety and quantity of the fossils increase with the number of birds in the SCP-4041 flock.

Fossils located via SCP-4041 appear nonanomalous. They exhibit a high degree of preservation and detail, with feather imprints and skulls often intact; all fossils match generally accepted taxonomic timelines. Eleven new species and seventeen new subspecies have been tentatively accepted by Foundation paleontologists.

SCP-4041-1 instances are translucent Class III Incorporeal Entities, and resemble theropod dinosaurs in various states of decomposition. All instances with visible skin lack feathers.

**Timeline of SCP-4041 Incidents**  

Date

Notes

1861

Friedrich Witte and Karl Häberlein discover the first _Archaeopteryx_ skeleton unearthed in Germany. Later suspected to be an occurence of SCP-4041 due to the mentions made in Häberlein's journal of the "great and peculiar flocks of birds" seen that day.

1859-1863

British biologist Thomas Huxley learns of the recently discovered _Archaeopteryx_ and becomes an ardent proponent of the possibility of an evolutionary relationship between dinosaurs and birds.

04/16/1944

Collateral damage during bombing of Munich in World War II destroys rare _Spinosaurus_ fossils suspected to be compromised by SCP-4041. Surviving photographs and journals edited.

02/17/1971

Birds involved in most recent SCP-4041 event sustain severe, often fatal injuries during event; usually bite marks, dismemberment, blunt trauma, or complete crushing.

08/26/1996

SCP-4041 event leads to civilian discovery and publishing of _Sinosauropteryx_, the first publicly documented feathered dinosaur. First instance of birds sustaining injuries outside of the duration of the event.

01/19/2002

Dr. Pascal Godefroit, a Belgian paleontologist, sustains similar bite injuries after publishing an article describing dinosaur-bird phylogeny. He is hospitalized and claims to have seen incorporeal, dinosaur-like entities. After Godefroit's recovery, he is amnesticized and the cover story of a car accident is disseminated.

09/15/2004

SCP-4041 event ends prematurely due to death of all birds present during event. Cameras detect a translucent silhouette resembling a _Tyrannosaurus rex_, designated SCP-4041-1.

02/13/2006

SCP-4041-1 instances destroy several museum displays and theropod fossils.

07/01/2009

SCP-4041-1 instances manifest within a Foundation paleontology conference, injuring 22 before MTF Phi-2 ("Clever Girls") and MTF Mu-13 ("Ghostbusters") arrive on the scene. (See Incident Log 4041-119 for details.)

> **16:14** Four MTF Phi-2 agents arrive on the scene, and enter from the back of the conference room. Three instances of SCP-4041-1 are present; two indistinct raptors and one _Deinocheirus_[2](javascript:;). The raptors have bitten five researchers already, while the _Deinocheirus_ stands over one attendee.
> 
> **16:15** Phi-2 agents fire at the raptors, to no effect.
> 
> **16:17** Phi-2 leader charges the raptors, flanked by her teammates, and vocally imitates tyrannosaur roars to challenge them. The raptors retreat. Site-wide evacuation commences.
> 
> **16:20** The raptors call to the Deinocheirus. It crouches over the prone attendee (identified as Dr. Karina Barrera), then joins the raptors.
> 
> **16:22** The Deinocheirus charges, knocks over one agent, and swats another with its tail. Several attendees are trampled.
> 
> **16:27** One raptor solidifies to bite on an attendee's leg; an agent shoots it in the head. The raptor screeches and disintegrates in a cloud of purple smoke.
> 
> **16:31:** The Deinocheirus attempts to flee, picking up Dr. Barrera and carrying her on its back.
> 
> **16:33** Mu-13 agents arrive and neutralize the remaining raptor instance using spectral weaponry. Phi-2 leader recommends capture of the Deinocheirus.
> 
> **16:36** Following setup by Mu-13 agents, Phi-2 agents use dinosaur calls to herd the Deinocheirus into the CHALICE-class spectral containment ring, which activates and successfully contains the instance.

Following treatment of all injuries and subsequent moving of the SCP-4041-1 Deinocheirus to a permanent containment cell, Dr. Barrera was interviewed.

> **Interviewer:** Phi-2 Agent Angelica Iglesias  
> **Interviewee:** Dr. Karina Barrera
> 
> **\[BEGIN LOG\]**
> 
> **Iglesias:** State your name, for the record.
> 
> **Barrera:** Doctor Karina Maria Barrera Campaña.
> 
> (_Iglesias places a large file folder on the table._)
> 
> **Barrera:** How's your arm?
> 
> **Iglesias:** Just a scratch. Look, Karina, let's just get through this. Right now I want to know exactly what went down at the conference.
> 
> **Barrera:** Ghost dinosaurs. Not the weirdest thing in our world.
> 
> **Iglesias:** Come on. I've read the 4041 documentation, I know there's ghost dinosaurs. What I want to know is how you got through without a scratch while 16 other people have Jurassic Park scars.
> 
> **Barrera:** Jig's up, I guess.
> 
> **Iglesias:** What the hell did you do?
> 
> **Barrera:** Right, so remember that paper I published in '07? The one about ornithomimoids and striations on their arms and wing anchoring bones.
> 
> **Iglesias:** Yeah, of course. Read all your stuff.
> 
> **Barrera:** Yeah… okay so, that wasn't _all_ me.
> 
> **Iglesias:** I know you're not a plagiarist, Karina. Get to the point.
> 
> **Barrera:** Okay okay. Three weeks before the submission deadline I had a dream. I dreamed of a _Deinocheirus_ and a _Gallimimus_ and a couple others. They showed up in my room, but they weren't ghostly at all. They were fully fleshed out, most vibrant colored scales I'd ever seen. Not a single feather on 'em.
> 
> **Iglesias:** Right. And this… fever dream inspired you to crank out that paper?
> 
> **Barrera:** _Sí._ They stood different, looked different — nothing about them fit the standard model. I went back into our database and cross-referenced the records, but ignored all fossils associated with SCP-4041. What I ended up with didn't look like the standard model at all. They looked like the things in my dream.
> 
> **Iglesias:** Wait, so what are you saying —
> 
> **Barrera:** Doesn't it strike you as just a _little_ suspicious how perfect the 4041 fossils are? They're _too_ well-preserved. You got feather imprints on a Troodon in the same formation as a single fragmented Triceratops foot. It's like a murder scene with the fingerprinted gun left behind with a confession note.
> 
> **Iglesias:** I mean, there's plenty of other ways to explain it.
> 
> **Barrera:** Yeah, that's what I thought, too. So I decided to test it: I got to work publishing articles critical of the standard model. And you know what happened? Every time I exposed a flaw, someone found an answer. Sternum not the right shape to support a transition? Next 4041 fossil, there it is.
> 
> **Iglesias:** But… why? Why would anyone do something like this? Who would want to create an entirely false fossil record?
> 
> **Barrera:** (_sighs_) You're gonna think I'm crazy.
> 
> **Iglesias:** At this point, I don't think anything is too crazy.
> 
> **Barrera:** (_whispers_) I think it's the birds.  
> **\[END LOG\]**

Dr. Barrera died two days later in a car accident, when she collided head-on with a semi-trailer truck. Investigation of the scene found a _Velociraptor_ skull in the car's trunk.
