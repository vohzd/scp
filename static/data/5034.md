**Item #:** SCP-5034

**Object Class:** Tiamat

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to budgetary concerns[1](javascript:;), it has been determined that containment of SCP-5034 is not currently possible. When SCP-5034 is discovered in an antique store[2](javascript:;), Agents are to immediately proceed to said store and begin experimentation.

Use of standard testing equipment is authorized in regards to SCP-5034. All tests must be approved by the Foundation Experimentation Committee[3](javascript:;).

**Description:** SCP-5034 is the collective term for a china bowl[4](javascript:;) containing seven red marbles[5](javascript:;).

At all times, SCP-5034 will consist of the china bowl and the seven red marbles within it. If a marble is destroyed or removed from SCP-5034, it will disappear and a new one will reappear inside the bowl. Attempts to contain marbles outside of SCP-5034[6](javascript:;) have similarly failed. All attempts to interfere with these marbles have had an extremely negative impact on the Foundation's budget[7](javascript:;).

SCP-5034 exhibits a secondary anomalous effect. All individuals who observe SCP-5034 will be aware that it is a china bowl containing seven red marbles, even if they lack prior context[8](javascript:;). However, this awareness does not appear to directly impact information one step removed from SCP-5034. For example, an individual observing SCP-5034 will be aware it is a china bowl, but an individual observing evidence left behind by SCP-5034 will not[9](javascript:;).

> **Experiment 5034-1**
> 
> **Conditions:** Upon discovery of SCP-5034, Foundation personnel attempted to remove and contain three marbles from the bowl[11](javascript:;).  
> **Result:** When removed, all marbles disappeared and reappeared inside the bowl. Containment failure[12](javascript:;). Foundation budget severely impacted.

> **Experiment 5034-2**
