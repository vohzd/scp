Nanga Parbat.

**Item #:** SCP-3833

**Object Class:** Geographical

**Containment Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-3833 has been constructed one kilometer below SCP-3833's lower bound to assist in monitoring and containment efforts. No personnel or civilians are allowed to enter SCP-3833, aside from D-class personnel equipped with recording equipment for testing purposes. A no-fly zone is to be enforced around Nanga Parbat under the guise of Standard Cover Story 088 ("Weather Hazard").

**Description:** SCP-3833 is a rectangular volume of space centered on the summit of Nanga Parbat, a mountain in the Himalayas mountain range. The lower bound of SCP-3833 is approximately six kilometers above sea level, and SCP-3833 is one kilometer in width and length. The upper bound of SCP-3833 is unknown[1](javascript:;), but is believed to be between 20 and 30 kilometers above sea level.

SCP-3833 plays host to two known anomalous phenomena, designated SCP-3833-1 and SCP-3833-2. SCP-3833-1 is a recurring phenomena where the conditions of Nanga Parbat will become extremely severe. An unusually intense snowstorm signifies the arrival of SCP-3833-1. SCP-3833-1 often involves:

*   The aforementioned snowstorm, described as being strong and very cold.
*   Rock formations becoming increasingly difficult to climb.
*   Equipment failure becoming increasingly common.
*   Areas of the mountain become iced over and hard to navigate.

Without intervention from SCP-3833-2, death due to SCP-3833-1 is unavoidable. Circumstances attributable to equipment failure prevent subjects from exiting SCP-3833. None of this anomalous phenomena has been observed by subjects outside of SCP-3833. SCP-3833-1 tends to only affect solo climbers or small groups, though SCP-3833-1 has been known to cause the crashes of commercial airliners flying through SCP-3833 on rare occasions. SCP-3833-1 typically lasts 3 to 6 hours before subsiding.

SCP-3833-2 is a cabin located within SCP-3833. Though GPS devices left within SCP-3833-2 do not change location, SCP-3833-2 has not been observed outside of SCP-3833-1 occurrences. SCP-3833-3 is a Caucasian male of Slavic descent who inhabits SCP-3833-2, apparently as its caretaker.

In approximately 33% of all SCP-3833-1 occurrences, the subject will find SCP-3833-2. SCP-3833-3 will invite the subject to enter SCP-3833-2. Once they are inside, SCP-3833-3 will coerce the subject into staying in SCP-3833-2 to shelter themselves from SCP-3833-1. Once SCP-3833-1 has subsided, the subject will be given proper equipment to descend Nanga Parbat if their equipment was broken.

**Discovery:** SCP-3833-1 and SCP-3833-2 came to the Foundation's attention after mountain climber Jerry Helder ascended Nanga Parbat and encountered both SCP-3833-1 and SCP-3833-2. Helder posted about this incident on his mountain-climbing blog, where it was flagged by Foundation webcrawler I/O-BLACKLEECH for potential anomalous activity. The blog was seized by Foundation assets and the post was deleted.

**Addendum 02/01/2018:** All attempts to find SCP-3833-2 using long-range surveillance has failed. In all instances, SCP-3833-2 only appears during manifestations of SCP-3833-1. Similarly to SCP-3833-1, SCP-3833-2 is unobservable outside of SCP-3833, making observation outside of SCP-3833 impossible.

With authorization from Site Director Graham and Resource Marshall ██████, short-range interaction through D-class personnel has been approved. Fifty D-class personnel of above-average physical health have been allocated to Site-3833 for use in this operation.

One group of four D-class personnel is to ascend Nanga Parbat and then descend the mountain. Should they ascend and descend successfully, another group is to ascend the mountain. Should they encounter SCP-3833-1, they are to attempt to find the cliffface where SCP-3833-2 is located. If they find SCP-3833-2, they are to enter and use audiovisual equipment to record interactions with SCP-3833-3.

Five groups encountered SCP-3833-1, and only one encountered SCP-3833-2. No further incursions into SCP-3833 are planned.

We will have sniper rifles trained on them at all times[2](javascript:;) to ensure compliance. Do you have anything to say before I send you up?
> 
> **D-2344:** I already fucking hate this.
> 
> **Agent Krunt:** Great. Well, you know your mission, please begin to ascend the mountain.
> 
> _The groups begins to ascend Nanga Parbat. 15 minutes and 43 seconds of little interaction._
> 
> **D-8990:** I think we're outside earshot of Agent Cunt and his minions now.
> 
> **D-0110:** Don't call him that! Remember what-
> 
> **D-8990:** Yeah, what are they gonna do? Shoot us down for making shitty puns? Fat chance.
> 
> **D-2344:** Shut up, Marty.
> 
> **D-8990:** Shut the hell up, Fred.
> 
> _The group continues to ascend the mountain, until they reach a very tall cliff-wall._
> 
> **D-0110:** Fucking hell, how are we supposed to climb this?
> 
> **Researcher Calvin (Over Radio):** You have a winch in your backpack.
> 
> **D-5671:** Wait, you're still listening in on us?
> 
> **Researcher Calvin:** Affirmative.
> 
> _Pause._
> 
> **D-8990:** So, is Agent Cunt there with you?
> 
> _33 minutes 46 seconds of little interaction. Wind begins to rise in intensity._
> 
> **D-0110:** It's getting pretty fucking windy up here.
> 
> **Researcher Calvin:** Is it also cloudy?
> 
> **D-2344:** Yeah, it's basically overcast.
> 
> _Cloud cover prevents direct observation of the group through satellite telescope._
> 
> **Researcher Calvin:** This could be the anomalous storm we're looking for. Remember to keep close to the walls and watch your step, and try to navigate to \[REDACTED\]
> 
> **D-0110:** Got it.
> 
> _2 minutes 12 seconds of little interaction. The group reaches a relatively flat part of the mountain._
> 
> **D-2344:** Stop pushing me around, Marty.
> 
> **D-8990:** Wasn't me.
> 
> _The wind pushes D-2344 to the ground, and slides him towards a nearby cliff. D-2344 manages to employ his ice pick, but the end of the pick breaks off, and D-2344 falls into a chasm. Fall is assumed to be fatal._
> 
> **D-8990:** Jesus fucking Christ.
> 
> **D-0110:** I can swear to god there wasn't a chasm there a second ago.
> 
> _18 minutes 23 seconds of little interaction, aside from complaints from the group about the environment._
> 
> **D-5671:** Fuck, it's getting colder by the minute up here. My coat isn't helping at all.
> 
> **D-0110:** The snow's like a spray of fucking bullets.
> 
> **Researcher Calvin:** Remember to go to \[REDACTED\]
> 
> **D-8990:** You-
> 
> _Interference with audiovisual equipment makes communication impossible at this point. Signal is not received for fifteen minutes until backup equipment is remotely activated._
> 
> **D-8990:** I can't fucking take it anymore. It's too intense.
> 
> **D-0110:** Wait, I think I hear something?
> 
> _Analysis of audio at this point has revealed that the sound of a man's voice can be heard through the storm._
> 
> **D-8990:** It's coming from over there!
> 
> _The group rounds a corner and discovers a wooden cabin matching descriptions of SCP-3833-2. A man, presumably SCP-3833-3, is standing in front of the door and yelling._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Hey! Over here!
> 
> _The group enters SCP-3833-2. SCP-3833-3 closes the door to SCP-3833-2._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Welcome to the top of the mountain. Would you like something to drink?
> 
> **D-5671:** Fuck yeah. I'm fucking dying from thirst.
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 leads the group over to a set of two worn, red couches and a stone fireplace. SCP-3833-3 then enters a kitchen area to make drinks._
> 
> _The group takes their coats off._
> 
> **D-0110:** Damn, these couches are comfy.
> 
> **D-8990:** I'm guessing it's just because we're finally out of the fucking cold.
> 
> **D-5671:** This reminds me a bit of my grammie's old cabin. I can swear to God she had that _exact_ same painting of a moose…
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 enters the room carrying a tray of four cups of hot chocolate. SCP-3833-3 reacts with shock at a series of dermal abrasions on D-0110's arm and chest. SCP-3833-3 puts the tray down onto a table in between the couches, and the group begins to drink._
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 takes out a metal box underneath one of the couches, and takes out a small, unlabeled bottle of liquid from the box._
> 
> **D-0110:** What's that?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** A bit of medicine for those scars.
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 applies some liquid to his hand and then uses his hand to apply it to D-0110's arms, and a previously unseen set of abrasions on D-0110's chest. SCP-3833-3 then wraps gauze from the box around D-0110's arms._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** It won't heal right away, but that should take the pain away. Make sure you keep the bandages on.
> 
> **D-0110:** Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
> 
> _The group sits in silence for three minutes until they finish their drinks. Personnel at Base Command push the group to ask SCP-3833-3 interview questions._
> 
> **D-8990:** So, what's your name?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** You can call me Russel.
> 
> **D-8990:** Alright, Russel, what is this place?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** It's a cabin I built here a while back. Nothing more.
> 
> **D-8990:** Alright. Why is it so damn stormy up here?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** The higher up you get, the colder it gets. If I'm not mistaken, that's how it works for every mountain.
> 
> _Pause._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Did you enjoy your drinks?
> 
> **D-5671:** They're great. They taste all sweet and fuzzy.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Well, it's getting pretty late now.
> 
> _It is of note that the approximate time was 9:03 PM._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** You must be tired, after all that's happened today. Would you like to rest?
> 
> **D-0110:** Would I? I'd kill for a half-decent cot.
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 stands up._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Follow me.
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 leads the group into a hallway adjacent to the living room, and then to a bedroom. The room contains two bunk beds with red comforters covered in blue stars. The walls and ceiling are colored blue, and covered with a white spiral pattern. A window on one wall allows for a view of SCP-3833-1. A spruce dressing stand is pressed against the remaining wall, and has a beige lamp and a blue analog clock resting on it._
> 
> _The group slides into the bunk beds and goes to sleep. Audiovisual equipment is set to deactivate for six hours during night time._
> 
> _The next day, SCP-3833-1 is still in the process of occurring. Personnel stationed at Site-3833 confirms the precense of SCP-3833-1. This means that SCP-3833-1 has been occurring for 9 hours, making it the longest occurrence of SCP-3833-1 to date._
> 
> _After a short period of time, the group leaves the bedroom to find SCP-3833-3 in the living room, staring out the window._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** The storm doesn't usually last this long. I don't think you'll be able to go out, so I guess you'll have to stay here.
> 
> **D-0110:** That sucks.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Hey, it's not all bad. I'm making muffins, do you want any?
> 
> _Once the group finishes eating breakfast, they begin to play board games such as checkers and chess by SCP-3833-3's suggestion. Little interaction is recorded during this period._
> 
> **D-8990:** Hey, do you have cable up here?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Unfortunately, no. It does get lonely up here, but I doubt anyone would be able to run a cable up here.
> 
> **D-8990:** I think we're missing the Super Bowl up here.
> 
> **D-5671:** Oh crap, you're right!
> 
> **D-0110:** Which teams are playing again?
> 
> _89 minutes and 45 seconds of little interaction._
> 
> **D-0110:** And… checkmate.
> 
> **D-5671:** God damn it.
> 
> _D-5671 walks up to SCP-3833-3, who is working in the kitchen._
> 
> **D-5671:** Russel, do you have any other games? I swear to God, if I lose another game of chess to Clyde I'll throw myself out the window into the damn storm.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Well, I do have something else…
> 
> _The group sets up a game of_ Dungeons & Dragons. _They play for 164 minutes and 33 seconds without interruption._
> 
> **D-5671:** I take out my sword and fight the elf.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Alright, then roll initiative.
> 
> _The group rolls twenty-sided dies._
> 
> **D-0110:** Fuck yeah!
> 
> **D-8990:** Another fucking natural twenty? I swear to God, Clyde, what _are_ you?
> 
> **D-0110:** Jackson Evergreen, level two Ranger, warrior of Neverwinter, and soon-to-be killer of elves.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Alright, you get to go first, Clyde.
> 
> **D-0110:** I peg 'im between the eyes with my crossbow.
> 
> _D-0110 rolls a die._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** You miss. It's now the elf's turn. He casts Eldritch Blast on Crogon-
> 
> **D-8990:** Fuck me, _another_ sorcerer?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** It's Micheal's turn, now.
> 
> **D-5671:** I walk up and stab the fucker in the neck.
> 
> **D-0110:** Damn, in the _neck_? We gotta catch this guy for information!
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** You're almost as cruel as the mountain, Micheal!
> 
> _Pause._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Anyways, roll for damage.
> 
> _The group continues to play_ Dungeons & Dragons _for a while longer, before stopping and sharing personal stories._
> 
> **D-5671:** …and then I got the fuck out of the [stairwell](/scp-087) before the creep got me. Then I got transferred to here, and I had to climb this damn mountain. That's my story.
> 
> **D-0110:** Alright, Russel, it looks like it's your turn.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Well, all of you have so many interesting stories, and I'm sorry for being so dull. I was born in Kaliningrad half a century ago. I had a relatively quiet childhood, before I went to Saint Petersburg to study Culinary Arts. I was a chef for the better part of my life, then I came up here.
> 
> **D-8990:** _<At the insistence of Researcher Calvin, connected through radio.>_ But why did you come up here in the first place?
> 
> **D-0110:** I'm more interested in how he got up here, with the storms and all.
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 pauses._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** It all started when a close friend of mine died here on the mountain. I was devastated, and at the funeral I vowed to make sure nobody died up here again. My vows were strong, and my will stronger, so I constructed a humble cabin to shelter the poor fools who came up here.
> 
> _SCP-3833-3 begins to cry._
> 
> **D-8990:** What's wrong, Russel?
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** It's not the storm, it's the mountain. The mountain _hates_. It hated Randall back when it swallowed him up. It hates every little person who tries to climb up the mountain. It hates you. And it _especially_ hates me.
> 
> _Pause. SCP-3833-1 is still occurring, creating a record time of 25 hours for duration._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** I'm alright. It's getting pretty late, now. We should go to bed.
> 
> _The group goes to bed. Audiovisual equipment is shut down to preserve power. However, equipment is not reactivated by the group in the morning. Remote activation is necessary. SCP-3833-1 has died down. The equipment is still in the bedroom. The following audio is audible through the equipment._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Ah, you're up quite early.
> 
> **D-5671:** That's because we made a decision. We're going to stay here.
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** Pardon?
> 
> **D-0110:** Yeah, you're right, this mountain fucking sucks. But you don't have to stay up here alone.
> 
> **D-5671:** We'll help out wherever we can, we promise.
> 
> _Pause._
> 
> **SCP-3833-3:** I don't see why not. It gets a little bit lonely up here, and I'm tired of just having my thoughts for company.
> 
> _The equipment does not record any more dialogue, and runs out of power 72 hours later._

> **STATUS REPORT**
> 
> * * *
> 
> On 07/19/2018, another group of five D-class personnel were made to ascend Nanga Parbat, and encountered SCP-3833-1. The group was directed to \[DATA REDACTED\], where SCP-3833-2 was located. It was discovered that two new cabins were built next to SCP-3833-2, apparently for the residence of the original group sent up to SCP-3833-2. The D-Class sent to investigate were persuaded to remove their equipment and enter the cabins. These personnel are considered to have integrated to this community of D-class personnel and SCP-3833-3.
> 
> The two new cabins have been designated SCP-3833-2A and -2B. Due to the risk of sending trained agents into SCP-3833, and the risk of losing more D-class personnel to SCP-3833-2, no further personnel are to ascend Nanga Parbat.
