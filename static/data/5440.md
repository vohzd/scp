**Item #:** SCP-5440

**Level 1/5440**

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Unrestricted**

#### **Archived Containment Procedures**

SCP-5440 is contained at its point of origin and a temporary pavilion is to be constructed around it. Two security personnel are to remain present in the pavilion at all times to prevent civilian exposure.

All public and personal records containing evidence regarding SCP-5440 are to be confiscated, destroyed, and/or discredited; all witnesses will be amnesticisized and released.

#### **Description**

SCP-5440 was a phenomenon affecting a Scarlet Bush (_Hamelia patens_) located in the University of Florida's botanical garden. SCP-5440 caused the bush to spontaneously combust and remain burning for approximately two and a half hours. This process did no damage to the affected bush, nor the surrounding vegetation. During the duration of SCP-5440, a disembodied voice (designated SCP-5440-1) could be heard near the bush. SCP-5440-1 spoke in fluent English and was able to engage in conversation. The process that created the SCP-5440 phenomenon is currently unknown.

#### **Discovery**

On 2020/04/21 at 9:45 AM GMT, SCP-5440 began and all attempts by campus staff to extinguish the fire were met with failure. At 10:00 AM, SCP-5440-1 began vocalizing the "Lord's prayer" and continued to do so repeatedly for one and a half hours. The Foundation became aware of SCP-5440 through rumors of a "talking bush", spread through UoF student's social media accounts. It was at this time that a Foundation containment team was dispatched to conceal and recover SCP-5440.

#### **Incident Report**

Initial containment procedures were established by Preliminary Containment Team Charlie-24 at 11:30 AM. At this time, personnel attempted to communicate with SCP-5440-1; the following is a transcript of the encounter.

**Interviewer:** Junior Containment Specialist Victor Redfield

**Interviewed:** SCP-5440-1

* * *

**\[BEGIN LOG\]**

**Redfield:** H-hello, I'd like to speak with you, if you're done with the praying.

**SCP-5440-1:** God? I can't believe it worked! God, I must ask for your mercy, please lend my sister aid.

**Redfield:** I'm not– My name is Victor, I'm definitely not anybody's "god".

**SCP-5440-1:** V-Victor? I don't understand, Lord. Have you not heard my prayers?

**Redfield:** What are you talking about?

**SCP-5440-1:** Gran, she done tole us… She done said t'would work! I prayed at the firebush, just like she say, and you done answered… y-you must be the Lord.

**Redfield:** Kid listen, I'm not God. I don't know what's happening here, but I know that for certain.

**SCP-5440-1:** Please, I need help! My sister done gotten hurt, an' she ain't right. My pa, he ain't here, an' I don't rightly ken what needs doin'. Please… Victor.

**Redfield:** I can't help if I don't know where you are.

**SCP-5440-1:** I'm right here! Right in front of your bush, uh, you.

**Redfield:** Kid, I'm in fron–, where is the bush?

**SCP-5440-1:** Out back behind the house, of course.

**Redfield:** And _where_ is your home?

**SCP-5440-1** We're stayin' in Hogtown, north side of the old Arredondo Grant. Least that's what pa's always sayin'. Please I ain't got ti–

**Redfield:** Arredondo? Is that Florida? What date is it, kid?

**SCP-5440-1:** Why does that– Uh, fourth ah August, the year of our… uh, 1832.

**Redfield:** Jesus.

**SCP-5440-1:** Is he with you? He can surely save Annabelle!

**Redfield:** No, I.. Um, listen, kid, I don't know if I can help you. You're… Uh, really far away.

**SCP-5440-1:** Please, she's bleedin' real bad! I done tore one of ma's old sheets like I done see Doc Willems do, but I– I can't get it to stop!

**Redfield:** What happened?

**SCP-5440:** She fell– she fell on the garden stake. I done pull out of her leg but… the bleedin' won't stop, and pa done gone 'round to– he aint fixin' to be back for at least two nights!

**Redfield:** Shit… Um, I can– _might_, be able to help you. But you have to listen to me carefully.

_\[**Redacted for Brevity:** Junior Specialist Redfield explains to SCP-5440, in detail, rudimentary wound care utilizing objects found within SCP-5440-1's residence. After 35 minutes, SCP-5440-1 successfully stitches and dresses the wound.\]_

**SCP-5440-1:** I can't thank you enough, Victor, you done saved Annabelle!

**Redfield:** I don't know about that, kid, you did all the work; I just helped you along.

**SCP-5440-1:** Never you mind that, mister. I rightly ken I'm in your debt, now. How could I ever repay you?

**Redfield:** Well, now that you mention it. Can you tell me how you contacted me?

**SCP-5440-1:** You don't know? I said the prayer, 'course. Jus' like Gran always said to.

**Redfield:** Could you tell me this prayer?

**SCP-5440-1:** I ain't seein' a reason not to, you done saved my sister. Gran done told it to me like this–

_\[SCP-5440-1 begins speaking an unknown language[1](javascript:;) for approximately two minutes, at which time SCP-5440 extinguishes and the anomalous phenomenon terminates.\]_

**\[END LOG\]**

Following this event, the bush affected by SCP-5440 was kept under surveillance for additional anomalous phenomena. After one week SCP-5440 was re-designated neutralized. Victor Redfield was reprimanded for improper interview protocol and placed on a one-week paid leave. Due to the nature of the incident, this disciplinary action will not be included on Victor Redfield's permanent record.

Attempts to recreate SCP-5440 using the incantation provided by SCP-5440-1 have met with failure. The Thaumaturgy Division's analysis revealed no adherent thaumaturgical value to the incantation, indicating an unknown factor or prerequisite must be required. Testing has been abandoned indefinitely.
