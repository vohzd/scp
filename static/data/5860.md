#### **Special Containment Procedures**

The virtual world platform known as 'SimulaCe' is to be strictly monitored and locked down. Social media posts related to SCP-5860 are to be cataloged for analysis, while emergency protection protocols are to be placed on uncorrupted sectors of SimulaCe.

Social media sites are to be observed for further manifestations of SCP-5860, with primary keywords related to it being 'escriter', 'censorship', 'journalistic determination', and 'cage for freedom'. All of the said actions are to be explained to the public as an anti-censorship campaign, while Protocol DAIGDIG is to be implemented in order to mitigate SCP-5860's socio-political effects worldwide.

MTF-Kappa-10 ("Skynet") is to commence communications with SCP-5860 in order to ascertain its motives and nature. Class-A memetic protocols and administrative permission to SimulaCe are to be accorded to the members. Negotiations will take place in a special sector of SimulaCe, in agreement with SCP-5860. Analysts are to also ascertain SCP-5860's demands for a 'hero of journalism'.

Concurrently, MTF-Kappa-10 is in charge of developing a method to neutralize SCP-5860's effects and presence, known as CENSERA.

An investigation of SCP-5860's relationship with GoI-503 (["Aviatica"](http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5630))[1](javascript:;) has been launched.

#### **Description**

![crow.png](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5860/crow.png)

An image that was constantly displayed throughout SimulaCe and on affected news platforms.

SCP-5860 is an anomalous digital entity that corrupts, erases, or memetically affects online content produced by news-sharing organizations, as well as significant groups and individuals that oppose governments worldwide.

SCP-5860 is centered on SimulaCe, a popular virtual world network[2](javascript:;), although related attacks on prominent social media sites have been recorded.

It has trapped 100,000 deep-immersion[3](javascript:;) SimulaCe users, with a particular focus on influential individuals, such as those related to mainstream media and journalism.

After its attack, 45 percent of all news-based websites are reported to only display a page aesthetically similar to the SCP-5860-related posts, with beeping and tapping sounds in the background. As for other social media websites accessed, their content was reportedly blurred and distorted.

35 percent of D-Class who have viewed these websites have reported headaches and nausea. They generally described it as a sharp, throbbing pain similar to being shot.

Notably, 40 percent of SCP-5860's posts, which continue as of now, indicate that it aims to 'fight for the good and vitality of journalism', despite stifling journalistic content. Individuals behind these posts have not been determined.

MTF-Kappa-10 was initially unable to access affected sites and online services, although it was able to trace SCP-5860 to a SimulaCe account named 'Escriter'[4](javascript:;). SCP-5860 was hosted on World-Server-053, a deep simulation server which is currently locked down by SCP-5860.

#### **First Manifestation of SCP-5860**

SCP-5860 first manifested on March 11, 2030. Before the attack, Foundation web crawlers had spotted a drastic increase of social media posts related to SCP-5860, as well as messages and announcements forwarded to an estimated three million SimulaCe users.

A transcript of the attack is provided below; the clearest recording was made by Eduardo Domingo, a news reporter of the ABS-CBN network who was covering SimulaCe due to a previous hacking attempt.

The CatLion during SCP-5860's first manifestation. Note the dimmed background due to SCP-5860's effects and SimulaCe protection protocols.

**\[\[00:00:00\]\]**

_Domingo uses a SimulaCe avatar that closely mimics his real-world appearance._

**Domingo:** Good day everyone, I am Eduardo Domingo, and I am bringing you the hottest news from the virtual world platform 'SimulaCe', for March 11! As you can see, despite the damage that the Kalinsker virus has caused on SimulaCe, the surroundings around -

\[\[FOLLOWING DIALOGUE OMITTED FOR BREVITY.\]\]

_At this point, Domingo's voice and avatar become distorted._

**Domingo:** <_Wincing avatar._\> … with that, we can conclude… CEO Valerian Hahndorf's statement on said issue…

**\[\[00:01:20\]\]**

Announcement boards display images of crows, pencils, and hats, often switching between them quickly. Moderate visual glitches now afflict Domingo and the other avatars.

**\[\[00:02:10\]\]**

The colors of the virtual landscape have been desaturated, although images related to SCP-5860 still retain their red hues. At this point, Facebook and Reddit also report manifestations of SCP-5860.

**Domingo:** It appears that we… we have been caught in a server-side issue… ABS-CBN will strive to report on this event, despite several… several technical difficulties.

**\[\[00:02:50\]\]**

SCP-5860's avatar, which is a humanoid figure with a crow replacing the head, appears. It is 140 percent larger than most avatars. Users report buzzing and a sound similar to beaks hitting wooden material, while several parts of the virtual landscape have been replaced with black, fluid-like material.

SCP-5860 then perches above the CatLion, a prominent virtual structure of World-Server-053. The CatLion begins to leak a similar black fluid from its paws.

**\[\[00:03:30\]\]**

SCP-5860 begins its speech, which was concurrently forwarded to users through text messages in SimulaCe.

**SCP-5860:** Hello Aviaticans! Please consider the surroundings, you there, please be considerate. Consideration is of course, an important matter, so I wish you will consider considering considera - ah, brevity, brevity, brevity! I forgot about the pen's creed, so I apologize. Please consider it.

_Silence for several seconds. A user then shouts._

**SCP-5860:** Alright, I suppose we shall get to the point - the point of the pen. You there, please don't move, you will shake off the ink! In any case, I properly introduce myself as Escriter, yes, an ecriter - a writer, truly yours.

**\[\[00:04:20\]\]**

_SCP-5860's then jerks its head, causing it to appear dislocated. A black fluid spurts out of its beak._

**SCP-5860:** Now, now, I request your cooperation with our campaign. I, I, _I_, Escriter, have arrived here to set the stage for oppression of online journalism. Ah, beautiful journalism, yet so unsafe and impractical for today's world. And so -

**Domingo:** <Shouting> Why would that be? What are your -

**SCP-5860:** How rude, Mr. Domingo, I do believe that you were not like that with us back then, non? In any case, we shall cage the truth-seekers for now, and there in that cage, they shall sing. _You_ shall sing behind the bars. But, I have a condition for you to be _freed_.

**Domingo:** …what would be the requirements for that?

**SCP-5860:** Once the _oppressors_ have been defeated, the _oppressed_ shall emerge stronger, right! Logical, logical, _considerably_ logical, right? And so… you need a 'hero' to lead and _unify_ the oppressed - to fight for you and the other men of the pen, right?

We simply need a 'hero of journalism' to fight against us. As for what that means, I fear that you have to wait one more week.

For now, please cooperate, so you and your minds will have to stay here for the time being. A writer such as me these days needs a weapon after all.

_The virtual landscape becomes more distorted, and beeping sounds increase. Figures similar to SCP-5860, save for their black uniforms, appear and pursue Domingo and the users, who struggle to fight back. ABS-CBN's link to Domingo terminates at this point._

Approximately 100,500 users who were still connected were trapped by SCP-5860. Attempts to remove several of these users from their immersion gear were unsuccessful, with all of them resulting in electrocution and severe brain damage. SCP-5860 then released a list of 300 trapped 'prominent journalists'[5](javascript:;).

#### **Contact Report**

MTF-Kappa-10 was given seven days in order to neutralize the threat posed by SCP-5860 and establish its nature and its connections to Aviatica. Due to moderate risks of cerebral damage to individuals who would 'immerse' themselves in World-Server-053, Generation 7 Mission AIC Cansigna was chosen to lead negotiations with SCP-5860.

In order to attract SCP-5860's attention, Operation BARKADA was implemented; MTF-Kappa-10 began flooding unaffected parts of SimulaCe and social media websites with posts in the same vein as SCP-5860's. 23 percent of these posts called for a partnership with SCP-5860, and allowing Cansigna to open communications with it.

The Foundation's prepared SimulaCe account was successfully given virtual world coordinates for the rendezvous. The transcript of the encounter is provided below.

**Cansigna Mission Log-5860-01**

— \[\[**BEGIN LOG**\]\] —

_The virtual landscape of World-Server-053 is partially corrupted. Prominent structures such as the Kanzler Building and the Tokimaki Pagoda have their walls covered by a newspaper-like texture, while the Dhoby Goat Fountain spurts out a black fluid. Avatars of trapped individuals are gathered in a cage floating over the Fountain._

_SCP-5860 is standing on top of the CatLion, which is being pecked on by approximately 50 crows. A humming sound can be heard in the background._

**SCP-5860:** Welcome, welcome! Are you the 'comrade'? Anyways, I do get the ruckus you made was _considerably_ attractive. Let's get to business then, let's be considerate of the time.

**Cansigna:** Of course. I am Cansigna from the Scribes' Creed Pillar. We are proposing a partnership with you and your organization, considering that we share the same goals, which is -

**SCP-5860:** Scribes' Creed Pillar - S.C.P. - it has a nice ring to it. In any case, the problem is that we're a bit too busy now, and having an unknown group such as yours will complicate matters, wouldn't it? The plan hasn't progressed past Stage 1 - _oppression_, that is - after all.

**Cansigna:** Escriter, it is expected that our journalist organization operates in secret, particularly since we have been hiding from Marshall, Carter, and Dark. Thus <_Raises hand._\>, we could not even afford to form connections with you until this moment.

**SCP-5860:** Hmmn, I see, I see. Marshall, Carter, and Dark - yes, they're very discreet 'Establishmentarians'. Even then, a journalist's strength - which is sadly what _those_ politicians also have - is rather dependent on connections. You are too inconsiderate of yourselves.

**Cansigna:** In any case, I reiterate that we offer to form a partnership to make your - and our - campaign more effective. Do you agree? The perks would be that you will have additional allies at your side. However -

_Cansigna spins around, and raises one of its hands._

**Cansigna:** There is one condition. You will have to release the trapped individuals. A moderate group of radical journalists such as ours do not necessarily agree on their state.

**SCP-5860:** …I did not necessarily ask for a partnership. Aviatica hasn't, hasn't yet!

Another thing - do you know why we need to go this far for a simple publicity stunt?

**Cansigna:** Why then?

**SCP-5860:** You see, everyone out there believes that all you need is a voice, a voice! They think that what a journalist needs nowadays is a pen, a laptop, a notepad, and of course, connections with influential individuals! I - We - believe that it is considerably, _considerably_, inadequate, and _inconsiderate_.

**Cansigna:** Please elaborate.

**SCP-5860:** As you can see, this is an act to cage 'online' journalism, so that when it blooms again, it would be more beautiful! However, we need to up the ante, so that everyone takes us seriously - we thus need much more than information that can be leaked, or not allowing access to websites.

Thus, we need to also cage the _minds_ and _people_ responsible for journalism!

**Cansigna:** …I see. I then propose a new deal - as part of our collaboration, you will gradually release trapped individuals, most of which you can order to 'fight' you for your purposes, while we provide information[6](javascript:;) that will suit your purposes. Would that be a good deal?

**SCP-5860:** Where's your proof of trust? Credentials? I can considerably agree that you need to be a secret, _secret_ group of journalists, but still, a handshake between each other should be safe, no?

**Cansigna:** We would be sending them now to your account.

**SCP-5860:** …Hmm… how logical, logical, logical! Or not, who knows? In any case, I do see your point. Please give us several minutes to consider it.

_11 minutes pass._

**SCP-5860:** Alrighty then, we have confirmed the credentials you sent us, 'S.C.P.', it is? My, my, how many companies[7](javascript:;) you have connections with! Jaa, let us get to the business.

— \[\[**END LOG**\]\] —

Discreet hacking attempts on SCP-5860-related accounts through conventional means are still unsuccessful. On the other hand, development on CENSERA has steadily progressed. Meanwhile, an investigation into Aviatica has been also launched, with its influence determined to be worldwide.

#### **Negotiation Report**

Negotiations with SCP-5860 have been smooth, with several meetings occurring over the course of two days. The Foundation has supplied select information to SCP-5860 about its shell companies, as well as current socio-political issues such as the De la Rosa VRWorld Affairs[8](javascript:;).

In return, SCP-5860 has granted the Foundation access to 20 percent of affected SimulaCe servers; this has drastically sped up development on CENSERA. However, it has not provided any data about Aviatica.

A transcript of the most recent meeting is provided below.

**Cansigna Mission Log-5860-02**

— \[\[**BEGIN LOG**\]\] —

_SCP-5860 is sitting on the CatLion, waving. It then suddenly dashes near Cansigna._

**SCP-5860:** Pray tell me, what do you think of journalistic trust? Just a curious question, after all.

**Cansigna:** …how sudden. Let us exchange greetings first.

**SCP-5860:** Don't you want to establish a level of trust like this? After all, we are good correspondents, non? In any case, hello, considerate Cansigna!

**Cansigna:** …I see. To consider your question, I would say that it is a rare commodity. From a certain point of view, it is surprising that we cooperate with each other like this.

**SCP-5860:** Correct, correct, very correct! Well, you see, our organization has always been a… paper butterfly, for a lack of a better term, but we don't stick too close to the flowers. And so, I reciprocate your feelings about our cooperation.

I do find it a bit uncomfortable, however, that it's always your side that is providing the information.

**Cansigna:** Trustworthiness is always a business, after all. Logically, it's very chaotic, and we could not afford mistakes about them.

**SCP-5860:** …I see, I see. It's just that S.C.P. - your organization - is ringing a few bells, as my comrades say. I must say… we're cautiously curious.

_Silence for several seconds._

**SCP-5860:** Oh well, I fear that we have led ourselves astray - we shall be cohesive. What are you proposing at this time?

**Cansigna:** About the trapped personnel, as well as the websites you have affected during our campaign, I believe that we shouldn't push any further. As you can see, massive outrage has been raised over individuals such Albert Kaminskov and Vermeil Vargas, to the point that I believe it is not conducive to our campaign.

**SCP-5860:** …Hmm, that's part of the plan, no? 'Oppress' them for at least two weeks, and sooner or later, someone, someone, _someone_, will take the _initiative_ to fight back - isn't that what we're expecting? But for now, we are just getting started. Rushing things before the deadline is something terrible for a writer, and will cheapen the masterpiece.

**Cansigna:** Would that be what you mean by creating a 'hero of journalism'?

**SCP-5860:** Exactly, my logical Cansigna!

**Cansigna:** Hmm, I see. Interesting.

**SCP-5860:** Pray tell me, Cansigna, are you starting to… doubt our partnership? Despite the trust that we have built -

**Cansigna:** No, no. I do not believe in such a course of action, as we will still continue to cooperate with you. Cheapening the act is highly inconsiderate, as you might say.

**SCP-5860:** I suppose. Still, I - no, we - have been gauging your capabilities from the very start of our relationship, wondering if you have the guts and the _resources_ to become the hero we wanted. _S.C.P._ - we had ascertained that you have far more unseen hands and strings, but we still consider that you are just another secret journalistic group like us, non?

But, if you are to become the 'hero' we want, do remember two things: we have a time table for that, and second, we will never cheapen the act. We will fight back as if we are true villains, I say, until said deadline, where…

Ah, I must say that I have gone rather off the trails - how inconsiderate! Still, I must save the surprise for Stage 2, since as I have said -

**Cansigna:** Along with getting pinned down by words, you dislike cheapening the act?

**SCP-5860:** Perfectly said, considerate Cansigna! Now, now, I do believe that we can call it a day for now?

— \[\[**END LOG**\]\] —

SCP-5860's requirements for a 'hero' are still unknown. Current priorities, judging by SCP-5860's statement of acting villainous, are preparing for intensified problems concerning SCP-5860.

#### **Report on Worldwide Public Reaction**

Public unrest has drastically risen against SCP-5860's activities, as internet usage and content has been limited. Political groups and individuals such as Christopher Go Jr. and Donald de la Rosa[9](javascript:;) have been prominently accused of instigating the previous events, while hacking attempts on SimulaCe and affected websites have increased.

Lead by activist Vermeil Vargas, a protest in EDSA[10](javascript:;), Manila, Philippines, has started to form, focusing on Domingo and the five other journalists who were trapped in SimulaCe.

Due to social media websites being affected by SCP-5860, similar riots have started in the USA, Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. Media personalities such as Karl Parleritz and Ping Liaoxi have denounced SCP-5860's actions.

As for the trapped individuals, the Foundation has cooperated with and given guidelines to various medical organizations in order to provide care for them.

#### **Incident PAHAYAGAN**

![paranoia.png](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5860/paranoia.png)

An SCP-5860 post two days afterwards.

On March 15, the number of SCP-5860-related posts suddenly increased, focusing on the issue of 'breaking the partnership' and 'self-trust for Stage 2'.

SCP-5860's effects have intensified, causing more severe migraines. Video streaming platforms such as Netflix and Youtube are now affected, while targeted content has expanded beyond journalistic matters.

The bodies of trapped individuals register higher blood pressure and mild cerebrospinal damage, with several of them electrocuted to the point of causing moderate injury.

On the orders of the O5 Council, CENSERA was implemented through a SimulaCe backdoor. However, it has been unsuccessful in neutralizing SCP-5860, due to its defenses that it repurposed from SimulaCe protocols. Despite changing attack patterns, MTF-Kappa-10 was unable to retake affected servers, as well as free individuals that SCP-5860 has gripped.

On the other hand, a communications link from Eduardo Domingo's account was received by emergency SimulaCe servers. A video recording was encoded in it, which is transcribed below:

Eduardo Domingo.

_Several avatars can be seen alongside Domingo's; all of them are located near the Takomaki Pagoda. The virtual landscape is distorted, while avian-like humanoid figures can be seen marching in the distance. Yells from other users can be heard._

Good day, this is Eduardo Domingo, reporting live from SimulaCe! In any case, let us get to the point now. Several users, with the help of SimulaCe administrators, have managed to establish a link, away from the clutches of Escriter.

As you can see, World-Server-053 is under a severe state of emergency, and that's precisely why we are calling you out; we believe that there is still hope under this oppression.

Currently, we are trapped; we are hostages of a certain individual, or group, in order to push their agenda of oppressing online journalism and men of the pen. While Escriter might say that it is fighting for the 'good' of journalism, current circumstances don't lend it credence. And thus, we are fighting.

_The video slightly freezes. According to SimulaCe operators, a data link was established by an unknown sender. Analysis indicates that this is related to Domingo and the other journalists' avatars._

Escriter is _currently losing_ - that, we can ascertain. Thus, we believe that we only need a little more push past its breaking point.

Against oppressors such as Escriter, we believe that everyone must fight. Inside SimulaCe, we are holding our lines, not just for our own lives, but for our own ideals. Thus, we expect… that you fight too.

Once again, this is Eduardo Domingo of the ABS-CBN network, keeping the flame for the fight alive, signing out.

— \[\[**END LOG**\]\] —

After Domingo's video was received, 21 percent of SimulaCe servers became unprotected, allowing MTF-Kappa-10 to override SCP-5860's grip on them. Analysis indicates that SCP-5860's defenses will be neutralized soon, although the fate of the trapped users is still unpredictable.

On March 25, SCP-5860 sent a video to the Foundation's SimulaCe account. It has been transcribed below:

_SCP-5860 is sitting on top of the CatLion. Flocks of paper crows periodically emerge from the CatLion's eyes, after which they would soar high and encircle the vicinity. A corrupted version of the song 'A la Volonte du Peuple' can be heard. Avatars of trapped users can be seen nearby._

Welcome, welcome, everyone! Please let me be considerate to you… or not.

Now, now, _now_, I address this to everyone whose hands are currently free - whose pens are currently free to oppose me! Particularly… to the folks at _S.C.P._! It still has a nice ring to it, even if my colleagues have dug up some… well… call them a journalist's connections.

Ah, we're beating around the bush! Such a writer's bad habit for me, considerably? But still, S.C.P. - Scribes' Creed Pillar - please consider the following.

Well, as for what's currently happening now, well, I must say that I will not considerably disappoint you with the next stage. _However_, trust in you is something that I can't rely on for the next stage of my plan. This time, call it a _journalist's instinct_.

Now, let's consider the situation - to use your arsenal of bullets and weapons against this poor writer's head of mine, you must be pretty desperate, non? If you are surprised at your hacking attempts being ineffective, I must say that in my tea parties with you, I really trusted you to the point that I had to stir my cup of tea with a gun.

Secondly, we still have the very brave, brave, _brave_ Eduardo Domingo and his fellow men here! It would be such a shame if what they were fighting for was lost to red tape and pointless bickering, isn't that right? _His acting_ was rather good, don't you think? Don't worry, they're all still _alive_.

However, we are not here to just stamp and stamp our boots into journalism and free speech. Quite the opposite actually, as we have been 'acting' to do so. Trapping those poor users for real and crippling the Internet for a week is just something to convince you so.

_Silence for a minute._

Now, for the next stage of the plan… I will allow you to 'defeat' us! And while you're at it, rescue the brave folks here!

After all, we are the _oppressors of the voice_, non? And so, it is proper manners to defeat such individuals, no? And it is proper manners, as I have said, for a 'hero of the pen', a 'hero of journalism', to defeat the oppressors, logically speaking.

_SCP-5860 emits a shrill sound._

You take on the role of the 'hero' against us, the Oppressors, and you have to pump the morale of the Internet against the Oppression! Of course, of course, we will be watching, and if you do anything undesirable, we can help ourselves to _everyone's_ data.

I will stake my journalistic honor for this. After all, the plan would have been well-executed at that point. And you see, for everything to work out, we will tone down our effects and grip on websites and SimulaCe - to the point that you can neutralize us more easily. Is that assurance enough?

In any case, now's the time for the pen to write its own terms. _In any case_, the pen wins!

To end on a graceful note, cooperate - no - provide a magnificent counter to us, 'Heroes'!

The O5 Council has voted on whether the Foundation should accept SCP-5860's offer or not. The results are provided below. Major points of contention were the benefits of cooperation, available plans of action, and the unpredictability of SCP-5860, in light of CENSERA's failure.

#### **Operation ESCRIBO**

A poster for encouraging public participation.

Operation ESCRIBO, with regards to the instructions of SCP-5860, was initiated under an unanimous vote of the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee.

In cooperation with prominent news organizations and NGOs, the Foundation launched mass journalistic campaigns worldwide, with SCP-5860 antagonized as the 'Escriterium'. Meanwhile, access to several affected websites has been partially reopened by SCP-5860, allowing the use of server farms, hashtags, posts, and user-created articles.

Two days into Operation ESCRIBO, the Foundation has produced 2,500 online articles, which either promote journalism or discuss controversial issues, for worldwide distribution, and made them and their related hashtags trend through various social media websites. It has been considered a general success.

Trapped individuals have been safely released from their immersion gear. Most of them described the event as a 'slow, harrowing experience'.

#### **Last Rendezvous with SCP-5860**

A meeting with SCP-5860 on World-Server-053 was scheduled five days after Operation ESCRIBO was launched. The transcript of the meeting is provided below.

**Cansigna Mission Log-5860-02**

— \[\[**BEGIN LOG**\]\] —

_The CatLion has been fully restored, although it is slightly discolored. SCP-5860 is standing on top of its head. Upon Cansigna's appearance, it then puts on a coat, and jumps near Cansigna._

**SCP-5860:** Welcome, welcome, the hero who defeated the Escriter, the pen's 'oppressor'! Still, I do considerably apologize for the lack of ceremony… or not.

**Cansigna:** It would be proper manners to greet you, so a good day at the very least. In any case, let us get to the point.

_Emitting a shrill noise, SCP-5860 raises its beak and several fingers upwards._

**SCP-5860:** I suppose you did pick up a new…_technique_, I would say. Setting the mood and flow of the conversation is a thing, thing that journalists and media men aspire to always do so, to get the right story, the right angle! How considerate of our prior activities.

**Cansigna:** …I suppose that you are not here to gloat. Speak up.

**SCP-5860:** How prideful… well, I suppose that something other than words pinned you down, then.

**Cansigna:** Let us get back to the topic, Escriter. It is not logical to beat around the bush. I suppose… that you do not know what you have awakened for now, no?

**SCP-5860:** The desire for a much transparent and fiery journalistic stance? That would be obvious, considering the political upheavals that are happening right now. Past the breaking point -

**Cansigna:** Breaking point. For us. You are partially correct on that part. Figure out the rest in five seconds, Escriter.

**SCP-5860:** …how cruel. A declaration of war then? The Establishment against the -

**Cansigna:** I will not like to get pinned down by words. Still, you should have realized the consequences of trapping 100,000 individuals and vandalizing websites, no? We're no longer capable of playing on the table with you, Escriter. It's time to turn it around.

**SCP-5860:** You know… if we're going to proceed down this route, then I would like you to view these documents, courtesy of our _connections_.

\[\[DATA RESTRICTED TO THE O5 COUNCIL.\]\]

**Cansigna:** …Foundation documents. So, what do you -

**SCP-5860:** As you can see, S.C.P. had a really nice ring to it, and over the course of our relationship, we as journalists, realized that, my, you had connections with TIME, The Tribune, and the News Star! Befitting of a hero with connections, non?

You have been rather _complacent_ when it comes to being clandestine, non? Complacency foils an otherwise _perfect masquerade_, no?

**Cansigna:** Not so much a matter of desperation to stay in secrecy, Escriter. Falsification and deception are part of the menu for us.

**SCP-5860:** …How prideful. You do know who you are talking to here? A worldwide organization of scribes, non?

**Cansigna:** You do know who you are talking to here? You did get swayed by our documents and enabled us to establish a relationship - admittedly, it was devoid of trust - with you.  
Throughout our meetings, we have been monitoring you too, and your relationships to individuals like _Domingo_… I must say, it was an elegant set-up.

**SCP-5860:** …What do you wish to fulfill… here?

**Cansigna:** There will come the day when you are the one with the broken masquerade. After all, we're truth seekers too, but we have to make sure they are _secure_ and _safe_ for the world. The statements of people like you can be _properly_ dealt with.

**SCP-5860:** Similar truth-seekers - the Establishment and Aviatica… How ironic it is that you are the ones who will truly _lock up_ the spirit of the truth and journalism, instead of us. Ah, how ironic, ironic, _ironic_!

**Cansigna:** As an example, we already have leads on who you are, and what Aviatica is. Starting with Domingo… then Kalinsky… then the Saavedra Group… please do be considerate of everything.

**SCP-5860:** That would be… hmm, it appears that you are a sleeping giant, non? Or rather acting like one. Which is which?

**Cansigna:** I will not get pinned down by my words, Escriter. At the very least, remember that your 'heroes' - 'heroes' against you - are serious here.

**SCP-5860:** …How interesting. Well, well, I do believe that this conversation can serve no further purpose. Let us correspond cordially, non?

**Cansigna:** That cannot be affirmed, Escriter. If you are a journalist as you always say, you must always know how to interpret the words of who you are fighting against, no?

— \[\[**END LOG**\]\] —

Afterward, SCP-5860's effects disappeared over two days, while SimulaCe and other affected platforms were rechecked and recalibrated. All accounts related to SCP-5860, except for 'aviatica', were deactivated.

Under the unanimous vote of the O5 Council, Operation PENHUNT is to be initiated in order to track down all individuals and groups related to SCP-5860 and Aviatica.

#### **Update (06/01/2035)**

As SCP-5860 predicted, support for online journalism and activism against 'Escriterium' and suppression of journalism has drastically increased, with it being the focus of mainstream media for three months.[11](javascript:;) Government upheavals in the Philippines and Indonesia have also been linked to SCP-5860's activities.

90 percent of individuals held by SCP-5860 have made full recoveries. Domingo, in particular, has been hailed by the media for speaking against SCP-5860, and rejuvenating public morale. However, the Foundation has commenced a full-scale investigation about him for his potential relations to Aviatica and SCP-5860.

SimulaCe, which was still recovering from the Kalinsker virus prior to SCP-5860, and other virtual world platforms, have seen an average 92 percent drop in usage and public trust. Online service producers were also similarly affected due to security concerns. Media companies have increased their focus on paper-based and television services.

As fears of a large organization focused on crippling journalism have increased, the UN has pledged to combat Escriterium, declaring it to be the 'threat of the century to the free press'. A PV-Class Status Upheaval Scenario has been implemented with regards to SCP-5860's worldwide impact.
