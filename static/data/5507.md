Item #: SCP-5507

Euclid

#### **Special Containment Procedures**

Two SCP-5507-1 instances are held within Biological Containment Unit-41 at Site-701. Automated systems will dispense their basic daily food requirements, which consists of 56 grams of meat product. Testing of SCP-5507-1 instances must meet SK-BIO Type 004 safety standards and be approved by the current HCML supervisor.

The organs, tissue samples, heads, and blood samples of two SCP-5507-2 instances are stored within Biological Storage Locker-49. The autopsy report for either of these instances is available upon request. Any living SCP-5507-2 instances that are recovered are to be held within Euclid-class humanoid containment chambers.

SCP-5507-3 is stored within High-Security Artifact Locker-8 at Site-51. Testing is limited to Biomancy Research Team personnel with clearance level 3/5507 or higher.

The investigative branch of Mobile Task Force Zeta-8 is to continue monitoring GoI-0707. All action taken against GoI-0707 must be approved by the Director of Site-701 and the Japanese Department of External Affairs Chief Liaison. Under no circumstance are Foundation assets to directly target high-profile members of GoI-0707, without the explicit approval of O5 Command.

#### **Description**

[![sig](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5507/sig/medium.jpg)](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5507/sig)

Monshō belonging to the House of the Blood Lotus.

SCP-5507 is the designation for several anomalies with connections to GoI-0707 ("House of the Blood Lotus[1](javascript:;)"). GoI-0707 is a multifaceted Neo-Sarkic organization based in Japan, with significant ties to the Japanese government and financial sector. Originally discovered by the Foundation in 1978, the true scope of their influence and membership is currently unknown. The federal and prefectural governments of Japan have been consistently uncooperative and, in some instances, confrontational regarding GoI-0707 and its activities. Esoteric practitioners of the group typically specialize in three forms of biomancy (pheromancy, faunal transfiguration, and Fumeiniku[2](javascript:;)), as well as traditional carnomancy typically employed by Neo-Sarkic sects.

SCP-5507-1 are carnivorous cephalopodic SK-BIO Type 004 organisms of varying size and composition[3](javascript:;), typically used as concealed traps within GoI-0707 compounds. Unlike non-anomalous cephalopods, SCP-5507-1 instances do not require water and are capable of deriving oxygen through spiracle-like orifices throughout their body. SCP-5507-1 instances possess neither auditory nor visual organs, rather utilizing a combination touch and hyper-sensitive olfaction to sense their surroundings. Instances typically have twelve to eighteen tentacles, each with hundreds of mouth-like orifices lined with serrated teeth. In order to be stored within small containers, SCP-5507-1 instances are capable of constricting their bodies into spaces several times smaller than their own size.

SCP-5507-2 is the collective designation for a group of female humanoids employed and created by GoI-0707. Individual instances vary in age, ranging from approximately 20 to 30 years old. Each instance has received the following identical modifications:

*   Lack of facial features and orifices.
*   Compact musculature, allowing for greatly increased strength and speed.

[![gir](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5507/gir/medium.jpg)](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5507/gir)

An SCP-5507-2 instance.

*   Wrist orifices lined with venom sacs that secrete toxins through a specialized mucus membrane.
*   25 cm bone spike formation within the forearms, capable of retracting through the wrist orifices.
*   Ten organic sphincters located on the back, utilized in the release of various airborne chemical compounds.
*   A series of complex internal organ systems capable of creating and storing a near-infinite variety of chemical and pheromonal compounds.

SCP-5507-2 instances are highly obedient and will instantly respond to any command given by their superiors. For this reason, GoI-0707 typically uses the SCP-5507-2 as personal attendants and bodyguards.

SCP-5507-3 is an 85 cm curved single-edged blade composed of an unknown carbon-based organic metalloid, only capable of being correctly wielded by practitioners of biomancy. When the mekugi[4](javascript:;) is gripped by a biomancer, SCP-5507-3 will fuse with the wielder's hand and forearm, integrating fully with their appendage. When used on a biological organism, SCP-5507-3 does not cause injury in the manner typical of a sword, instead causing drastic biological mutations to the organic tissue within its immediate vicinity.

SCP-5507-3.

  

#### **Addendum 5507/1**

On 1996/05/22, Mobile Task Force Kappa-26 ("Wake Watchers") uncovered evidence that a major transaction was to take place between Vivian Durant-Croÿ (presumed leader of the reformed  
GoI-0490 - "Adytum's Wake") and a ranking member of GoI-0707. The exact cargo was unknown at the time, but agents discovered the time, date, and location of the delivery. The item (later revealed to be SCP-5507-3) was shipped from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Narita International Airport (NRT) by members of GoI-0490, at which time SCP-5507-3 was remanded into the custody of GoI-0707 operatives.

[![loc](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5507/loc/medium.jpg)](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5507/loc)

Location of the GoI-0707 compound.

  
Operation Red-Handed was to be carried out by the newly formed MTF Zeta-8 ("Izanami's Spear")[5](javascript:;), on 1996/05/29. Reconnaissance specialists were instructed to monitor the delivery of SCP-5507-3 and then track the GoI-0707 operatives to their destination, at which time MTF Zeta-8 would evaluate and raid the location.

At 19:35 GMT, SCP-5507-3 arrived as scheduled and was hand-delivered to a man accompanied by two SCP-5507-2 instances. From the airport, the GoI-0707 operatives traveled south by car for 1.5 hours, to a remote residential property in the southwest of the Chiba Prefecture. The reconnaissance team reported at least 25 individuals were on the premises, seemingly gathered for some sort of event. Two four-man teams of MTF Zeta-8 were deployed to raid the compound, the following is a partial transcription of the event:

**Team 2:** ζ-7/02, ζ-7/06, ζ-7/07, ζ-7/08

**Foreword:** The property has two main buildings; the central building where a majority of the guests are located and the southern building where the reconnaissance team witnessed SCP-5507-3 being taken into. Team 1 is to secure the central building as Team 2 secures the southern building.

**\[BEGIN LOG\]**  
**Team 1**

**ζ-7/02:** Approaching the southern building, going dark.

**ζ-7/01:** Copy.

_\[ζ-7/01 is crouching behind a bush, the main entrance is visible from his position.\]_

**ζ-7/01:** I have eyes on the north entrance, everyone else in position?

**ζ-7/04:** Eyes on the eastern entrance.

**ζ-7/03:** West is covered.

**ζ-7/05:** I'm on south now.

**ζ-7/01:** Set timers for 30 seconds.

_\[Multiple affirmations.\]_

**ζ-7/01:** Move on zero, start… now.

_\[After 30 seconds a small beep is heard, ζ-7/01 sprints for the door. Removing several zip-ties from his hip pouch, ζ-7/01 quickly seals the door.\]_

**ζ-7/01:** North sealed.

**ζ-7/04:** East sealed; one guard down.

**ζ-7/05:** South is sealed, but, uh, have you had a look inside ζ-7/01? Aside from the faceless chicks, this looks like a normal party.

_\[ζ-7/01 slowly moves to the window nearest the door. The scene inside correlates with an average dinner party, a few dozen men and women drinking and engaging in conversation. A total of four SCP-5507-2 instances can be seen in each corner of the room.\]_

**ζ-7/01:** ζ-7/03, what's your status? _\[Pause.\]_ ζ-7/03?

**ζ-7/04:** I'll check his last known.

**ζ-7/01:** Negative. Remain in your positions. I'll go ch–

_\[ζ-7/01 turns around to find an SCP-5507-2 instance standing directly behind him, pointing a bone spike at his abdomen. With a blur of motion, the SCP-5507-2 strikes ζ-7/01 in the gap in his body armor, before stepping back.\]_

**ζ-7/04:** Boss we got movement. I think they kn–

**ζ-7/05:** You okay, ζ-7/04?

_\[The camera view becomes obscured as ζ-7/01 collapses face-first on the ground.\]_

**Unknown Male:** _彼をここから連れ出すように。お客様にこの騒動を見せるわけにはいきませんから。_ (Take him away, and make sure the guests don't see this mess.)

**Team 2**

**ζ-7/02:** Approaching the southern building, going dark.

**ζ-7/01:** Copy.

_\[Team 2 is crouched next to a small outhouse, behind the southern building. ζ-7/07 hands ζ-7/02 his GAD[6](javascript:;)\]_

**ζ-7/07:** Take a look at the thermal scan.

**ζ-7/02:** So, we've got three rooms, the middle has three people. The other two have one each. I'm going to assume they're keeping it in that center room.

**ζ-7/06:** What's the plan?

**ζ-7/02:** ζ-7/06, go around and take the front room; ζ-7/08, you take the back. ζ-7/07, we're going through the roof, right into that center room. Okay, in positions, we'll breach at the same time.

_\[Multiple affirmations as the team splits up. ζ-7/07 reaches the building first and begins to climb to the roof. As ζ-7/02 arrives, ζ-7/07 reaches a hand down to assist her.\]_

**ζ-7/02:** Thanks.

_\[ζ-7/02 brushes herself off before she and ζ-7/07 make their way to the center of the roof.\]_

**ζ-7/02:** Set the Knock[7](javascript:;) up here.

_\[ζ-7/07 puts the device down and after inputting several commands; the device displays a green light, indicating it's operational.\]_

**ζ-7/07:** All set, Boss.

**ζ-7/02:** _\[Static as she switches radio channels.\]_ ζ-7/01, we're about to make contact, what's your status?

**ζ-7/01:** _\[Static.\]_

**ζ-7/07:** You think they're alright?

**ζ-7/02:** It doesn't matter, we have a job to do.

_\[ζ-7/02 checks her weapons before removing a flashbang from her hip pouch.\]_

**ζ-7/02:** We breach in 30, set the timers. I want flashbangs on entry, take no chances. If they don't surrender, kill them.

**ζ-7/06:** Understood.

**ζ-7/08:** _\[Static\]_

**ζ-7/07:** ζ-7/08, you're breaking up, come in, ζ-7/08.

**ζ-7/02:** We don't have ti–

_\[The roofing ζ-7/02 and ζ-7/07 are standing on ripples, causing the two agents to lose their balance. A flashbang goes off in the distance as the roof splits open and the two agents fall through.\]_

**Unknown Male:** _ようこそいらっしゃいました。こそこそする必要はありません。_ (Welcome, welcome, no need for sneaking about.)

_\[ζ-7/02 lifts herself to her knees. A man of Japanese descent is standing in front of her, two SCP-5507-2 instances are at his side. SCP-5507-3 can be seen on display behind the man. The SCP-5507-2 instances are holding the riffles of ζ-7/02 and ζ-7/07.\]_

**Kurata:** //私は倉田達夫と申します。 お会いできて光栄です。(My name is Kurata Tatsuo, it is a pleasure to meet you.)

**ζ-7/02:** You okay, ζ-7/07.

_\[ζ-7/07 groans as he lifts to his hands and knees.\]_

**ζ-7/07:** Just peachy, Boss.

**Kurata:** もう1つ持ってきてください。(Bring in the other.)

_\[An SCP-5507-2 instance opens the left door and drags in ζ-7/06 and drops him on the floor next to ζ-7/02.\]_

**ζ-7/02:** _このクソ野郎！_ (You bastard!)

**Kurata:** _落ち着け、まだ死んでない。_ (Calm down, he's not dead.)

_\[Karata clears his throat before turning away from the agents. He begins to pace in front of SCP-5507-3.\]_

**Kurata:** Now that we're all here, I will speak in your native tongue, as such you may not misunderstand my words. You, whom we have never interfered with, have interrupted a joyous occasion. The return of a most sacred item.

_\[Kurata stops and places a hand on SCP-5507-3.\]_

**Kurata:** Like many of the relics of my homeland, it was lost to us after the war, and we have merely returned it to its rightful home. So, tell me– why have you chosen to interfere? Have you no reverence for these lands?

**ζ-7/07:** Don't act innocent– we know what you are! You stand there and expect us to bel–

**Kurata:** Silence! You know noth–

**ζ-7/07:** Silence this!

_\[ζ-7/07 draws his sidearm and aims for Kurata. The air next to ζ-7/07 ripples as a man manifests next to him wearing a tight-fitting dark blue shozoku. The man is holding ζ-7/07 by the wrist and shoulder; the gun falls from his hand as the man tightens his grip.\]_

**Kurata:** You look surprised– did you really think these dolls _\[Kurata pats one of the SCP-5507-2 on the head.\]_ were the only security we had?

_\[Kurata claps his hands together twice. Multiple points in the room ripple as five additional shozoku-wearing men appear.\]_

**Kurata:** They have been standing right next to since you stepped foot on the property.

**ζ-7/02:** W-why did you let us get so far in?

**Kurata:** What sort of hospitality would that be? You came to see the _目醒めし刃_ (Awoken Blade) and see it you shall.

_\[Kurata grips the handle of SCP-5507-3, his hand rapidly expanding into a large mass of mutated flesh. Kurata points the blade at ζ-7/07 as the veins in his arm turn black.\]_

**Kurata:** Let's have a demonstration.

_\[ζ-7/07 struggles against the man holding his arm as Kurata approaches. With one swift motion, SCP-5507-3 passes through ζ-7/07's arm, the flesh and bone rippling as it separates from his body.\]_

**ζ-7/07:** _\[Incoherent screaming.\]_

_\[ζ-7/02 attempts to stand, Kurata points SCP-5507-3 at his chest.\]_

**Kurata:** _You_, will wait your turn!

_\[ζ-7/02 slouches back as ζ-7/07's severed arm grows patchy orange fur. The arm morphs and grows, taking on a mutated vulpine appearance. A smaller version of ζ-7/07's face appears where the vulpine organism's head should be. Its facial expression twists into a pained sneer as the organism screams. Its raspy voice distorting and echoing as it quickly scurries from the room.\]_

**Kurata:** Beautiful isn't it, now let's see wh–

**ζ-7/08:** Everyone down!

_\[Several seconds after ζ-7/08 shouts from the next room, a bright light fills the view, accompanied by the loud pop of a flashbang. Automatic gunfire is heard as the GoI-0707 operatives erupt in flame, blood sprays the camera lens. ζ-7/08 and ζ-7/05 enter the room from both sides.\]_

**Kurata:** _これで貴方は逃れられますまい!_ (You won't get away with this!)

_\[As Kurata prepares to lung forward, ζ-7/02 removes her knife and cuts along her right palm twice.\]_

**ζ-7/02:** \[DATA EXPUNGED\][8](javascript:;)

_\[ζ-7/02 lurches toward Kurata and grabs him by the forearm and slams her now burning right hand into his face, removing his head with a burst of flame. SCP-5507-3 falls from the now-deceased man's arm. The camera view is obscured as ζ-7/02 collapses to the ground, indecipherable shouting can be heard before the sound of a door slamming open.\]_

**Soldier:** _全員動くな！_ (Special Forces Group, nobody move!)

**\[END LOG\]**

* * *

**Afterword:** Shortly after MTF Zeta-8 engaged the GoI-0707 operatives, a 50-man detachment of the Special Forces Group (SFG)[9](javascript:;) seized control of the property. Of the eight Foundation agents on the property, all but ζ-7/07 survived the encounter.

Among the civilians present during Operation Red-Handed were several prominent government officials (including PoI-0707/5[10](javascript:;)) and over a dozen notable Japanese businesspeople. The SFG arrested all Foundation personnel on the property under suspicion of domestic terrorism. While on its way to the property, the concealment team was stopped by a second SFG team and was similarly arrested. In total, 28 Foundation personnel were detained by the SFG.

During the SFG raid, the reconnaissance team remained undetected and witnessed four members of GoI-0707 (two of which were SCP-5507-2 instances) leave the premises with SCP-5507-3. A third four-man team from MTF Zeta-8 was deployed to intercept the item while being transported. The following is a partial transcript of the recovery:

**Date | Time:** 1996/05/22 | 22:12 GMT

**Team 3:** ζ-7/10, ζ-7/11, ζ-7/12, ζ-7/13

**Foreword:** Team 3 has successfully performed a PIT maneuver on the SCP-5507-3 transport vehicle.

* * *

**\[BEGIN LOG\]**

_\[Team 3 exit their vehicle and approaches the GoI-0707 transport.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** ζ-7/12, ζ-7/13 go around the other side.

_\[The rear door of the vehicle swings open and an SCP-5507-2 instance lunges out. ζ-7/10 fires his shotgun three times, the explosive rounds bisect the instance at the waist.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** _全員手を挙げたままその畜生車から出ろ。_ (Everyone, out of the fucking car with your hands up.)

_\[Team 3 is now surrounding the car, ζ-7/11 and ζ-7/13 ignite their flamethrowers.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** _よし、これから10数える。その合図で我々はお前の車でお前をウェルダンにする。刃ならお前の灰から回収できるだろう。_ (Right, I'm gonna count to ten, then we're just going to cook you in the car. We can collect the blade from your ashes.)

**ζ-7/10:** 一つ… 二つ… 三つ… (One… Two… Three…)

_\[The remaining three doors of the car open simultaneously.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** _これで良し。_ (That's more like it, nice and slow.)

_\[The remaining SCP-5507-2 instance exits the vehicle first, followed by the driver. SCP-5507-3 is fused to the driver's right arm.\]_

**ζ-7/10:**_  
今ふざけてんじゃねえよ。_ (Don't be foolish now.)

**Driver:**_  
お前みたいなヤツに俺が牢屋にブチこまるこたぁねえよ。_ (I won't be jailed by someone like you.)

_\[The driver plunges SCP-5507-3 through his own abdomen, his entire body begins to ripple. Several tentacles, wings, appendages, and scales morph from the driver's body._\]

**ζ-7/10:** Burn 'em.

_\[ζ-7/11 and ζ-7/13 fire their flamethrowers at the driver, which shrieks in response as it collapses inward on itself. The remaining SCP-5507-2 instance is caught in the crossfire. As it flails silently on the ground, ζ-7/10 walks up and fires two rounds into the instance.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** ζ-7/12, take the other one alive.

_\[ζ-7/12 gives an affirmation as she approaches the open front passenger door. The agent yelps as an SCP-5507-1 instance attaches to her face.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** Mother fucker.

_\[ζ-7/10 sprints to help ζ-7/12 as she struggles on the ground. Using his knife, ζ-7/10 stabs the SCP-5507-1 instance as he pulls it free from ζ-7/12's head. ζ-7/12 shrieks, the skin on her face and scalp tearing loose as the SCP-X-1 instance is pulled away. ζ-7/10 drops the instance, recoiling as the now-skinless head of ζ-7/12 falls to impact the ground with a wet sound.\]_

**ζ-7/11:** These ones are done. What about that one.

_\[ζ-7/10 stands straight and turns around; the remaining man's corpse is slouched in the passenger seat. The skin on its cheeks torn from the SCP-5507-1 exiting its mouth. Police sirens can be heard approaching.\]_

**ζ-7/10:** Dead. The same goes for ζ-7/12. ζ-7/11 bag the blade, ζ-7/13 help me get all these bodies in the transport. We need to leave.

**\[END LOG\]**

* * *

**Afterword:** Team 3 successfully recovered one severely injured SCP-5507-1 instance, two deceased SCP-5507-2 instances, and SCP-5507-3.

The SCP-5507-1 and SCP-5507-2 instances were transported to Site-701; due to the risk of a GoI-0707 recovery attempt, SCP-5507-3 was transported to the United States to be stored at the Site-51 Maximum Security Facility.

After 32 hours of negotiations, the Foundation was able to secure the release of all 28 personnel incarcerated during the operation.

#### **Addendum 5507/2**

On 1996/05/25, the corpse of Director Ryo Osaki[11](javascript:;) was found within his home office. The top section of Director Osaki's skull was removed and an SCP-5507-1 instance was placed within his cranial cavity. The phrase 刀を返せ (Please return the sword) was branded on his chest. Analysis of footage captured by Director Osaki's home surveillance equipment was inconclusive in discovering the identity or point of entry of the assailant.

The internal security protocols of Site-701 were upgraded immediately following this event. Due to the incidents involving SCP-5507, the GoI-0707 Engagement Risk Value (ERV) was raised to Level-5.
