SCP-5858

**Item #:** SCP-5858

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5858 is physically self-contained, but requires active censorship. All outbound communication from the town of Ambler will be screened, and revised by Site-24 AI _DONA_. Individuals made aware of SCP-5858 will be given Class-A amnesics.

Personnel must strictly adhere to their role when entering this Locked Scenario[1](javascript:;). When asked to leave SCP-5858, personnel should do so as quickly and courteously as possible. Under no circumstance may anyone enter SCP-5858 posing as theater staff.

**Description:** SCP-5858 is the Ambler Theater, located in the borough of Ambler, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In 2018, this playhouse spontaneously entered a IO-Locked Scenario, and has since continued presenting "A Streetcar Named Desire" for 17,520 consecutive hours.

[Excerpt-LS | Locked Scenarios](javascript:;)

> **A Locked Scenario (LS)** occurs when an event, incident, or sequence of actions is anomalously extended past its logical expiration. These phenomena should not be confused with **Temporal Loops (TL)**, which create brackets of repeating time - Locked Scenarios merely repeat the event itself as time progresses. To achieve this effect, an LS will often alter human perception, along with any number of core scientific principles. Often mischaracterized as "hauntings" or "curses", some examples of Locked Scenarios in the Foundation database include [SCP-112](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-112), [SCP-4382](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4382), and [SCP-1337](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1337). As each of these documents demonstrate, Locked Scenarios can be incredibly dangerous, and require proper understanding for their safe containment and/or resolution.
> 
> An LS will operate under two set variables: _Protracted vs. Indefinite_, and _Static vs. Organic._
> 
> *   **A Protracted LS (P-LS)** will eventually self-terminate.
> *   **An Indefinite LS (I-LS)** will be self-sustaining.
> 
> High-sensitivity Kant Counters can be used to tell these phenomena apart. The more common P-LS will show a gradual decline in Hume levels, culminating in a total field collapse or "burnout". An I-LS will show steady, or bare fluctuations in Hume levels, and will always require some form of external resolution.
> 
> *   **A Static LS (S-LS)** will only repeat a sequence of events.
> *   **An Organic LS (O-LS)** will "progress" within its own set confines.
> 
> Consider this separation in terms of a baseball game. In an S-LS, the game will repeat its nine innings over and over. In an O-LS, the game will continue into a 10th inning and beyond, with the score progressively increasing. Combining these factors, a Locked Scenario can be interchangeably characterized as PO-LS, or IS-LS, etc.

There are 87 individuals affected by SCP-5858 directly, including the actors, stage hands, and audience members. All other residents of Ambler have been passively affected by this anomaly, believing the unnatural duration of the performance is completely unremarkable[2](javascript:;).

SCP-5858-1 through 13 14 are the staff of the Ambler Theater, uniquely affected by the Locked Scenario. These individuals are easily identified by their red shirts, black vests, and perpetual full-body vibrations - visually resembling hummingbird wings in motion. All staff members have expressed enhanced speed, strength, and spacial awareness, operating at roughly 5 times that of baseline human capacity. While staff members will continue to perform their routine duties, albeit at a faster pace, their primary purpose is to act as Locked Scenario "maintenance", aggressively preventing all outside interference.

**SCP-5858-TL Excerpts**:

\==============CONDITIONS\==============

\===========RESULT\===========

D-8743 is asked to enter SCP-5858, using a valid ticket, and posing as a patron.

Subject allowed entry, and safely watches the play for 23 minutes. Subject is then asked to leave for coughing too loudly[3](javascript:;).

D-8911 is told to enter SCP-5858 without a valid ticket, and to remain despite staff protests.

After 4 minutes of trespassing, SCP-5858-1 (87-year-old Donald Miller) lifted D-8743 over his head, sprinted down three flights of stairs, and threw him outside. D-8911 suffered six broken ribs.

D-9013 is asked to enter SCP-5858 posing as a member of staff.

**\[DATA EXPUNGED\]** D-9013 is now classified as SCP-5858-14. Testing has been suspended at this time.

To date, no test subject has managed to remain inside the theater for more than 3 hours before being ejected for some form of infraction.[4](javascript:;) On February 15th, 2020, Mobile Task Force Xi-5 "Newtons Bullies" were dispatched to contain/neutralize this anomaly.

> 
> **Site-24:** Oh, yes- of course. Report.

> 
> **Xi-5-4|Fletcher:** Right right, sorry. 5-1 and 5-2 took their seats near the front of the auditorium. The audience is fully embedded in the Scenario - no malnutrition, physical degradation or signs of distress. They don't even seem bored!
> 
> The play itself seems to be continuing way, way off the events of "Streetcar". Blanche escaped from the hospital several thousand acts ago, and is now on the run in Morocco. Stanley is still chasing her, but now it's because he was hired by Shep Huntleigh to hunt her down, since she stole this diamond that gives her supernatural-

> **Xi-5-4|Fletcher:** Right, yeah. Sorry, It's just… surprisingly engaging! I don't know if I could sit through two whole years of it but- wait, hold on.

> 
> **Site-24:** Guy? What guy? 5-4, what's happening?
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Fletcher:** About that. We think we've found the source of the anomaly. Remember when I said no one looked bored? Well, Higs- sorry, 5-2, he noticed someone who was.

> 
> **Xi-5-4|Fletcher:** What? Oh, no, no this guy was just sitting _next_ to the subject. Sa- 5-1 signaled me to take him out, so I followed him into the bathroom. I tried to play nice, really, but this guy really, really wants to get back to his seat!
> 
> **Site-24:** You were told not to break cover, 5-4. This _absolutely_ constitutes breaking cover.
> 
> **Xi-5-4|Fletcher:** Sorry Command, but like you said, we needed to work quickly. They know we're not supposed to be here. I can't even wipe my nose without one of those buzzing black-vested freaks shining a flashlight in my face! I feel like a germ in this theater's body, and the white blood cells are circling.

**Addendum - 15/02/2020 | 15:13:** All anomalous activity in Ambler abruptly ceases. Friends and family of those within SCP-5858 begin panicking. At the same time, the doors to SCP-5858 open, and people begin to exit. Many collapse into the street, openly weep, or stumble around catatonic. All members of Xi-5 report in safe.

**Addendum - 15/02/2020 | 15:17:** The last three audience members exit the theater. A young boy is seen standing between a man and a woman, holding both their hands. The trio walk down the town's main street until reaching the first intersection. They embrace, then walk a short distance in separate directions before vanishing.

**Addendum - Site-24 | Director Morgan:** Reclassification to Neutralized pending.

>

A young man in that kind of situation… he needs someone to reach out. He needs to know it's going to be alright. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do it any differently.
