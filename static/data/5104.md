PoI-9224 performing treatment on a patient

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5104-1 is to be contained in standard containment cell SCC-03, located at Area-179.

PoI-9224 has been integrated into the Foundation's internal structure as Level 1 personnel. On request, PoI-9224 is to perform Protocol-SPINAL-TAP upon SCP-5104-1.

**Description:** SCP-5104 is the collective designation for an anomalous relationship between two entities: SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224.

SCP-5104-1 is a serpentine entity of unknown origin. SCP-5104-1's physical appearance consists of a raised crest attached to a protracted, segmented vertebral column. Pairs of curved appendages are attached to this column, decreasing in length as the sets are arranged along SCP-5104-1's body. The biological composition of SCP-5104-1 is unknown.

SCP-5104-1 is capable of flight, elevating itself at an estimated 6 meters from the ground, and gliding forward at a gradual pace.

PoI-9224 is David R. Shaffer, a resident of Easttown Township, Pennsylvania, and owner of "Shaffer Chiropractic". PoI-9224 does not possess any apparent anomalous knowledge or ability aside from their relationship with SCP-5104-1.

SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224 are instinctively aware of each other's physical locations, no matter the distance. While SCP-5104-1 is not capable of vocalization, the entity chooses to communicate with PoI-9224 telepathically at a short range distance. Prior to containment, SCP-5104-1 pursued PoI-9224 in an attempt to interact with them.

**Addendum 5104.1:** Discovery

On 07/19/2020, at 17:38, Easttown Township law enforcement received a phone call from PoI-9224, who reported SCP-5104-1's presence, and claimed the entity was pursuing him. Within the next hour, multiple calls and reports from various witnesses were received as SCP-5104-1 moved through Easttown Township. Foundation agents intercepted the calls, and containment specialists were dispatched. Both SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224 were successfully contained and transferred to Area-179. Witnesses were amnesticized as deemed appropriate.

**Addendum 5104.2:** Interview

For informational and contextual purposes, an interview with PoI-9224 was conducted. An excerpt can be found below.

* * *

**<BEGIN LOG>**

**PoI-9224:** That's what I'm telling you! I was watching TV, then I blacked out. When I got up, I could see, no, _feel_ that thing. It was on 4th street, and I knew it was coming for me next. Can't explain it. Just knew.

**Dr. Trenton:** Interesting. And you don't have _any_ idea what could've caused this, hm? No playing around with things you shouldn't have? You're sure this hasn't happened before? Keeping secrets isn't helping anyone, Mr. Shaffer.

**PoI-9224:** I have no clue what you're talking about, honest. I'm a tax payer! I'm a chiropractor! I don't do that pagan shit, if that's what you're saying.

**Dr. Trenton:** Well Mr. Shaffer, it's not every day something like this happens. I hope you can understand my concern.

**PoI-9224:** Look, I love my country. I'll do anything to help you guys out, but I —

**Dr. Trenton:** (_Laughs_) Relax, I'm screwing with you. Hold.

_Trenton holds his hand to his ear, listening to a communication feed. After 20 seconds, he resumes._

**Dr. Trenton:** That was my colleague. We just finished your check. Upstanding member of the community, huh? Almost ran for mayor a couple times. Very impressive. On Yelp, Mr. Shaffer?

**PoI-9224:** (_Pauses_) What?

**Dr. Trenton:** Your business. Do you have a Yelp page?

**PoI-9224:** Oh, Yelp. I think my son set something up awhile back. Why?

**Dr. Trenton:** Check it often?

**PoI-9224:** Never.

**Dr. Trenton:** Figures. We checked it for you. This ring any bells?

Review taken from Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp page (hover to enlarge)

_Trenton slides a tablet across the table. A screenshot of a Yelp review is displayed on the screen. PoI-9224 examines the tablet._

**PoI-9224:** The hell's this?

**Dr. Trenton:** Review from your page, seemed suspect. Most recent one, posted minutes before the entity manifested itself in the middle of town. We were hoping you'd be able to provide context.

**PoI-9224:** Yeah, sorry. No clue.

**Dr. Trenton:** Understandable. Still feel the anomaly's presence?

**PoI-9224:** Uh, it's in a cell a few hallways down. He's a freaky bastard, that thing.

**Dr. Trenton:** What do you say we pay it a visit, huh? See what it wants.

**PoI-9224:** Absolutely not.

**Addendum 5104.3:** Contact

After a minor altercation, PoI-9224 was brought near SCP-5104-1's containment cell. Incident is transcribed below.

* * *

**<BEGIN LOG>**

_PoI-9224 stands in front of SCP-5104-1's containment cell._

**Dr. Trenton:** Go inside, Mr. Shaffer.

**PoI-9224:** It's going to kill me! No way in hell I'm going in there.

**Dr. Trenton:** Actually, it was quite docile during containment. Didn't lash out, showed no signs of aggression, what have you. As far as we can tell, the entity poses no physical threat.

**PoI-9224:** God.

**Dr. Trenton:** We could _put_ you there, Mr. Shaffer.

**PoI-9224:** Alright, calm down. Just so you know, I get my arm bitten off, I'm not afraid to file a lawsuit.

**Dr. Trenton:** I'm sure.

_PoI-9224 enters the containment cell. SCP-5104-1 is suspended in the air, its segmented body curled in the corner. Upon noticing PoI-9224, SCP-5104-1 unfurls itself and approaches Shaffer. PoI-9224 expresses distress._

**PoI-9224:** W — What do I do? It's coming towards me.

**Dr. Trenton:** Communicate! Talk to it!

**PoI-9224:** H — Hey! I'm not sure what I'm supposed to, uh, oh. _Oh._

**Dr. Trenton:** Yes?

**PoI-9224:** Christ, It's talking to me in my head. W —

**Dr. Trenton:** What's it saying?

**PoI-9224:** (_Pauses_) Wait… I see. It's, uh, telling me it's heard of my… praises? It wants me to work my…. healing treatment on it. The hell?

**Dr. Trenton:** If I hadn't been paying attention to context clues, that might've been a fun twist.

**PoI-9224:** Sir, I think this thing wants me to crack its… back. It keeps saying that it's hurt.

**Dr. Trenton:** That is what you do, Mr. Shaffer.

**PoI-9224:** You want me to give it chiropractic treatment?

**Dr. Trenton:** Crack the entity's back, Mr. Shaffer.

**PoI-9224:** (_Distressed_) It's a goddamn flying spine! Where do I even start?

**Dr. Trenton:** Just go for it. Should be relatively easy.

**PoI-9224:** (_Sighs_) I've cracked worse.

**<END LOG>**

* * *

**Researcher's Note:** _PoI-9224 enacted a two hour chiropractic session on SCP-5104-1. The entity displayed clear affection towards PoI-9224 and satisfaction with its treatment. SCP-5104-1 remarked to PoI-9224 that the treatment 'freed all pain' and '\[it\] gives 5 red shapes'._

_A more thorough examination of the entity has been conducted using anomalous symbology, imagery, and various threat-assessment protocols. It is almost certain that SCP-5104-1 is a non-malicious entity, and poses no immediate threat to the world or The Foundation at large._

_Considering this and due to PoI-9224's ability to perceive SCP-5104-1's presence at all times, a decision has been made to employ David R. Shaffer on-site as a practicing chiropractor and aide to SCP-5104-1 if need be. PoI-9224 has been granted Level 1 security clearances._

_SCP-5104-1 remains in containment, and is approved to receive treatment from PoI-9224 upon request._

**Addendum 5104.4:** Update

![yelp2.png](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5104/yelp2.png)

Review taken from Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp page (hover to enlarge)

On 07/27/2020, the following review was posted on Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp Page.

PoI-9224 was asked to communicate with SCP-5104-1. The entity informed PoI-9224 to 'prepare for healing', and refused to elaborate on this statement.

At 13:56, a massive portal manifested in Easttown Township, Pennsylvania. Several hundred entities similar in appearance to SCP-5104-1 emerged from the portal before its closure. Foundation personnel responded immediately, succeeding in containing the entities and preserving the Veil.

Following transportation to Area-179, PoI-9224 performed chiropractic treatment on the entities, the duration of the session lasting three days in total. Further information on SCP-5104-1's species remains pending.
