**Do you have approval from IntSCPFN database listings managers?**

SCP objects may not be formally documented in the International SCP Foundation Network's database until the document has been reviewed by the appropriate personnel. In order to create an SCP document without breaching publications protocols, your Site Director must first approve the object for inclusion on the database and listings managers must review and approve your draft.
