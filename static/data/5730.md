A captured instance of SCP-5730, referred to as SCP-5730-A.

* * *

#### **Special Containment Procedures**

A full blackout protocol is to be initiated on SCP-5730 under the guise of a military operation. Foundation trawlers and ships are to initiate a search for the remaining instances of SCP-5730, with agents additionally stationed in all ports to monitor sightings of SCP-5730. SCP-5730's routes are to be charted. Reports of 'whale-like' or 'jumping' submarines are to be verified.

Captured SCP-5730 instances are to be docked near Site-095 and investigated for their thaumaturgic properties and any documents and video cassette tapes that they may contain.

Embedded agents in PepsiCo are to obtain documents related to the company's sea-based anomalous operations, focusing on dossiers concerning SCP-5730. Existing deals with PepsiCo are to be enhanced in order to further monitor it.

#### **Description**

SCP-5730 refers to a fleet of 17 submarines that were obtained by PepsiCo from the Soviet Union in 1989 as payment for Pepsi products. It has been sighted in several parts of the world, particularly near countries in the Pacific Ocean[1](javascript:;).

SCP-5730 instances' behavior has been described as similar to orcas, evading nearby ships.[2](javascript:;) Video logs show that they typically emerge from the water, remaining in the air for around 15 seconds.

SCP-5730-1 are translucent humanoids observed atop SCP-5730 instances. These entities are unresponsive to communication attempts and show evidence of moderate bodily damage, such as burns and limping. These manage repairs on SCP-5730, while occasionally holding wine bottles, when SCP-5730 are surfaced.

SCP-5730 instances have been severely damaged near the engines and the aft hydroplanes. Their hulls have been cracked and breached to the point that their frames have been exposed. These can be explained as a result of age, as well as damage from SCP-5730's clashes with anomalies.[3](javascript:;)

When separated from the other instances by a range of eight kilometers, an instance becomes inactive and non-anomalous, with no signs of SCP-5730-1.

Official records state that SCP-5730 was sold off by PepsiCo in 1989, although it covertly operated until 2005. By then, PepsiCo had officially decommissioned SCP-5730, with its instances docked to be scrapped, before they suddenly disappeared on March 5.

#### **Report on Captured Instances**

![pepsi.png](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5730/pepsi.png)

A poster found in SCP-5730-A.

On November 20, several Foundation destroyers near Scarborough Shoal[4](javascript:;) registered SCP-5730 on their deep-sea scanners. Kilometer-long thaumaturgic barriers were set up at strategic points to block SCP-5730 and force it into an altercation with the destroyers.

Anticipating an End Around attack[5](javascript:;), the FSS _Jokoy_ and _Jose Rizal_ braced for impact. Several instances lobtailed them using their rudders and stern planes, causing moderate damage.

The destroyers deployed depth charges as a response, causing two SCP-5730 instances to surface. SCP-5730-1 instances could be seen manning deck guns atop them while displaying moderate panic.

One instance then emerged and crashed into the _Jokoy_, while other instances mounted surface attacks. The Foundation destroyers then adopted zig-zagging patterns and formations until they managed to separate and capture five instances.

Investigation of the captive instances' interiors has shown several notable modifications, listed below:

1.  Thaumaturgically-enhanced metal plating has been installed on all instances, allowing them to endure pressures of around 225 atmospheres[6](javascript:;). The plating appears to be based on methods seen in GRU-P and occultist Russian documents.
2.  The engines and nuclear reactors have been extensively modified.
3.  Their cargo holds' interiors are larger than what their exteriors would suggest.
4.  Maps detailing unknown oceanic regions[7](javascript:;) have been found alongside old PepsiCo posters.
5.  Heavily degraded photographs depicting unidentified individuals. The phrase 'Ang Buhay Natin Dati'[8](javascript:;) is inscribed on them.

**Regarding SCP-5730-1 - Background Check**

It has been determined that SCP-5730-1 instances closely resemble a 51-year-old individual named Baler 'Balyena' Suarez, a former PepsiCo employee who served as first officer aboard SCP-5730-A[9](javascript:;).

Records on his status conflicted as March started. Medical records state that he was rushed to the Manila Doctors Hospital due to liver cirrhosis. However, on March 5, he was spotted wearing his old uniform in Subic Bay[10](javascript:;), where PepsiCo headquartered its anomalous seafaring operations.

Videocassette tapes have been recovered from his home and transcribed. Three tapes are provided below.

**Tape 5730-031**

_Suarez sets up the recorder. His eyes are mildly swollen, and he yawns for several seconds. He then sits on the sofa, unsteadily gripping several documents._

**Suarez:** Takemiko… Job-hunting failed again this time. The guys at Intermodal did not want to accept an old and limping man. (_Faintly chuckles._) Well, who would anyway?

_He then rubs his badly burned face and stretches his limping leg._[11](javascript:;).

I don't know if I… uh - (_Silence for five seconds._) Sorry for the poor memory. But you see, the physical qualifications screwed me up a lot. In any case, it looks like I won't be on the seas again. Ahh, it's really difficult nowadays.

_Suarez coughs for several seconds, and rubs his head. He stands up and turns on the television. He then sits for 12 minutes, switching between several channels. He lingers on those that show basketball and an oceanographic documentary._

**Tape 5730-049**

_Suarez grabs several tapes from a box, and loads them into a VHS player._

**Suarez:** It's Day 20 now Takemiko… I'm planning something different today, kind of like, uh, a reaction video. I think that I'm the first one to do this sort of thing. Ah, wait, you and Bogda often did this to record your reactions to wild stuff. We had to smuggle these tapes out of the subs back then. (_Chuckles._)

_Suarez plays several tapes. The first depicted Suarez, several other employees, and members of an unidentified group as they rode on several dolphins and whales that carried PepsiCo products. The second showed him manning a control component of SCP-5730-A, with his captain ordering escape maneuvers._

_The third showed his crew drinking in an unidentified tavern, although the tape abruptly cut when he put his foot on the table after being dared._

_Rubbing his calloused fingers and right leg, he grins while watching these tapes._

**Suarez:** Can't believe I used to be so… wild. Without those guys, without Pepsi… I'd still be some deadbeat. Y'know, a life of adventure really was the thing for me, Takemiko… Though… a life full of adventure is something that needs to just roll on. I wish that was the case for me.

_Suarez chuckles and turns off the television. He then falls asleep on the sofa. For several minutes, only a faint, clinking sound could be heard._

**Tape 5730-075**

_Suarez is dressed in his old PepsiCo uniform and gear. He is slightly grinning and was chanting before he spoke._

**Suarez:** Takemiko… this is my last film roll here before I move on. (_Chuckles._)

In any case, don't look for me, and don't worry about me harming something; that won't happen unless I get cornered. To PepsiCo, I'll be taking some of the old whales - after all, they're gonna be scrapped, Quite a waste, if you ask me.

_Teka_, I forgot something.

_Sighing, Suarez then packs an unidentified jar into his backpack._

**Suarez:** Ya know, you, Commander Klassner and the others often had a lot of fun examining artifacts before submitting them to Pepsi. I reckon that procedure for them has changed in this decade, but hey, exploring stuff is still… (_Sighs and chuckles._)

_Suarez clears his throat._

**Suarez:** In any case… Look, I just want to have a whale of a good time again. It's time for this old orca to go back to the sea where he belongs.

#### **Update (05/07/2006)**

Reports of 'ocean blazes' and 'explosive sea bursts' in the West Philippine Sea were received by the Philippine branch of the Foundation, and the FSS _Marcelo Del Pilar_ was dispatched. On arrival, the _Del Pilar_ found the remains of three SCP-5730 instances. It also recovered 35 kg of wooden and leather parts[12](javascript:;) and a tentacular mass weighing 32 kg.

Tattered PepsiCo flags, with the words 'King of the Sea Once More' inked on them, were found inside the instances.
