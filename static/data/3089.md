Darrington, North Carolina (USA), circa 1961.

**Item #:** SCP-3089

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to monitor online communities for markers associated with SCP-3089. Should a community infected with SCP-3089 be identified, a joint operation involving [MTF Mu-4 ("Debuggers")](/task-forces#mu-4), MTF Nu-13 ("Rasczak's Roughnecks"), and [MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings")](/task-forces#gamma-5) is to be conducted to contain all members of this community and remove all evidence of its existence from the public record.

Prior to shedding their epidermis, SCP-3089-A instances are to be confined to standard human containment cells. Instances in Stage II are to be remotely monitored by Foundation medical staff on a 48-hour cycle to monitor their progression.

Stage III instances are to be transferred to HTH containment cells[1](javascript:;).

**Description:** SCP-3089 is a phenomenon that emerges among communities focused on developing methods to acquire physical, financial, and social prosperity. Although its precise pathology is not yet understood, affected communities are identified by several markers — the most prominent of which is a fixation on achieving material success via the application of [rituals](/scp-2852) associated with the [Cétlaidí](/scp-3004), or "Singers" (a Druidic cult active in Ireland between the 15th and 19th centuries).

![husk2.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3089/husk2.jpg)

SCP-3089-A instance (Stage III, post-autopsy).

SCP-3089-A instances are members of an affected community afflicted with SCP-3089-B — a form of chimerism incorporating exogenous genetic material from the _Cicadetta montana_, or New Forest cicada. SCP-3089-B emerges in accordance to the following progression:

*   **Stage I:** _Chrysalis._ The instance enters a state of severely depressed metabolism, brain activity, heart-rate, and body temperature. Over a period of 3-6 hours, the instance's epidermis hardens into a dense, brittle shell.

*   **Stage II:** _Metamorphosis._ Numerous small internal teratomas manifest within the instance. Over a period of 2-3 weeks, these tumors expand and dissolve surrounding soft tissue, replacing all functionality.

*   **Stage III:** _Emergence_. Once the majority of soft tissue has been replaced, the instance exits its dormant state, exuviates its outer epidermal shell, and emerges. It is now non-communicative, and will attempt to burrow into soil via any means at its disposal.

At Stage III, numerous organs (including eyes, lungs, and internal genitalia) are now vestigial; examination of the brain shows severe deviations from topographical norms.

SCP-3089 was first discovered by the Foundation in 1961 following the disappearance of an entire town's population in North Carolina. This town has since been demolished, and the region surrounding it purchased for observation.

**Addendum 3089.1:** Ministry of the Sevenfold Blessing

The following audio was recovered from magnetic cassettes found in the offices of the Ministry of the Sevenfold Blessing, located in Darrington, North Carolina (USA). They consist of recorded sermons given by Pastor Bartholomew Jenner; each was labeled with the name of the sermon and the date on which it was given.

I want to talk to you about… I want to talk to those of you who are struggling, right now. To those of you who have hardship and pain. Maybe you've heard that the Bible only nourishes the spirit; that God provides only for our immortal souls. Well, my friends, I am here to tell you that this is simply not true."
> 
> "You are a child of the most High God; the King of Kings. He has breathed His very life into you; His royal blood flows through your veins. He did not create you to just 'get by'. You are His child. You are His champion. He put you here to rise… to rise up and achieve _total victory_."
> 
> "Many of you can think of places in your lives where you have not yet risen. Where you are not yet victorious. Marriage. Finances. Health. But do not fret, my friends. God _wants_ you to rise. He has cleared the path for you. It is one littered with His earthly treasures; to claim them, you need only to shed your old selves and be reborn."
> 
> "Now, if you would — some of the ladies from the — thank you, ladies — some of the ladies from the mayor's office were kind enough to collect these cicada shells. Pass them along. Each of you take one — yes, the children too. Be careful. Very careful. They are fragile. Each of you, take one, and hold it in your left hand. Yes. The _left_ hand, not the right. Your left."
> 
> "Good. I want you to all close your eyes. Please, everyone. Close your eyes. I want you to visualize… I want you to imagine whatever hardship in your life you're struggling with, right now. Picture it. What is it? Your job? Your car? Your marriage? Is someone in your household sick? Picture it in your left hand. Picture yourself holding that problem…"
> 
> "…now, I want you to squeeze your left hand. Squeeze it into a fist. Feel that problem cracking; like old, dried out paper. Feel it crumble to dust."
> 
> "Everyone, open your eyes. Don't you feel better? Stronger? This is what is offered. Our hardships are like the shell; we shall cast them aside even as they crumble. God has cleared a path. Amen. Amen."

> 
> "Psalm, chapter twenty four, verse one: 'The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.'"
> 
> "Job, chapter forty-one, verse eleven: 'Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.'"

> "Both Heaven and earth are God's possessions; we are but tenants upon His property. Just as the angels are God's Heavenly servants, so are we His earthly ones."
> 
> "In chapter twenty-five of Matthew, verse thirty — the Parable of the Talents — God speaks: 'And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' What does this tell us? That the Lord casts aside those wicked servants who are content with mediocrity; those who do not seek to enrich their Master's possessions. Those who do not seek total victory."
> 
> "We are God's investment; it falls upon us to be a profitable one. He gave His only begotten Son, surrendered Him to the earth, so that He might rise from it and grant us life everlasting. We must demonstrate the wisdom and glory of this sacrifice, this investment."
> 
> "Now, some of you have expressed concerns over the new sacraments. A few — I will not say who, but a few — have even called them sacrilege. And yet, have we not prospered? Have these same nay-sayers — again, I will not speak their names — but have these same 'Doubting Thomases' not profited from our good works?"
> 
> "I have shown you how to heal the sick with the Lord's Prayer and the blood of an unbaptized child. I have shown you how to see your future in the steaming entrails of a quivering crow. I have shown you the path to glory. But I cannot make you follow this path. I can only show it to you; it is you and you alone who must follow it — who must rise and shed your old self."

(_laughing_) You think I'm joking. But yeah, an alternative approach is to retrain your brain. _Know_ you're sleeping with her. Because if you're hoping —

> 
> **VOICE 1:** Oh. Right.
> 
> **VOICE 2:** — you should always aim for the ten.
> 
> **VOICE 1:** Right. A lot of us walk into a room, see a ten, do a basic probability matrix, and tell ourselves: 'Okay, I've got no chance, I'll focus on the 7 or 8 LSE in the corner'. And that's just bullshit. Aim for the ten. You always aim for the ten. Because if you don't —
> 
> **VOICE 2:** Then you're not trying to be the best you that you can possibly be.
> 
> **VOICE 1:** Right. Exactly. Always go for the ten. Never sell yourself short. I mean, we're all products of evolution — a four billion year old iterative process dedicated to perfecting our ability to pass on our genes. We weren't put here to go for sevens and eights, you know? We're not here to win 2nd place. Go platinum or go extinct. Be a champion — or get out of the champion's way. If you're not gonna play hard, then you might as well just remove yourself from the gene-pool.

See these structures on the side? Those are 'tymbals'. The male cicada uses them to attract mates. (_laughing_) Well, I do, too.

It's crazy how this stuff can apply everywhere — you can use the same tricks in finances, health — even to develop yourself spiritually.

> A Foundation agent (Daniel Mitchell) performing a routine monthly patrol within the vicinity of Darrington, North Carolina noted the appearance of several sinkholes along the outskirts of the region. Further investigation uncovered an extensive network of tunnels extending several hundred kilometers outward before reaching the surface. A geological survey has determined that many of these tunnels are approximately four decades old.
> 
> Although a complete exploration of this space has yet to be conducted, preliminary searches have uncovered approximately 1.1 tons of semi-preserved organic animal material. This material is composed of severely desiccated dermis[2](javascript:;) tissue. Genetic testing reveals the presence of both human and _Cicadetta montana_ (or New Forest cicada) DNA.
> 
> As of this date, all previous inhabitants of Darrington have been tentatively designated as PoI-3089-1 through -985. An investigation into their current whereabouts is ongoing.
