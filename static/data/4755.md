SCP-4755, visualized.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation-influenced contacts within spheres of education, literature, and philosophy are to monitor general public awareness of SCP-4755 as a phenomenon. Additionally, obfuscation and/or interruption of study into SCP-4755 within these fields is not to occur. These two requirements do not constitute true containment procedures and are considered self-perpetuating.

Containment of SCP-4755 itself is impossible to achieve and has likely already occurred. However, containment of [MTF Tau-5 ("Samsara")](/task-forces#tau-5)'s team leader, T-5 Irantu _Mark-LXXII_, has been raised to an Alpha-Level Priority. The extant T-5 Irantu is not considered a threat at this time.

**Description:** SCP-4755 designates the ultimate purpose of conceptualization, which is containment. All human-derived concepts — including but not limited to literary constructs, philosophy, and emotions — aim to establish control over a threat, a disadvantageous narrative, or an opposing philosophy, in an analogous manner to the Foundation's containment of anomalous phenomena. Individuals participating in conceptualization are usually unaware of their ulterior containment motive, believed to result from SCP-4755's self-containing properties.

These conceptual effects are assumed to be retroactive in nature, suggesting large-scale alterations made to the local timeline and adjacent universes. It is currently hypothesized that SCP-4755 will be properly manufactured at some point in the future, but its effects have, practically, always existed.

Although the Foundation has been aware of SCP-4755 since 1987, its origin is as of yet unknown. Discovery of the method by which it will be created has, likewise, been obstructed.

Conducted studies and investigations have predominantly focused on its properties, which, while expansive, are believed to affect conceptualization in a tiered system. This has been illustrated below:

Designation

Description

Example

**Tier Null:** Physical

Observable reality, composed of matter and energy.

_N/A_; physical objects have not been affected by SCP-4755.

**Tier I:** Abstract

All thought-constructs pertaining to literature, philosophy, emotion, etc.

_"The Hero's Journey:"_ A cyclical literary trope wherein the hero begins as normative within a community, experiences augmentation of character or body without the community, and is unable to reintegrate. The community has effectively contained the anomalous individual by rendering its co-existence with the community impossible.

**Tier II:** Divine

All conceptualizations of deities or deific entities.

_"Yahweh":_ The arrival of Lucifer[1](javascript:;) in the Garden of Eden is believed to be a Biblical allegory for a containment breach, and the doctrine of Original Sin as the first re-definition of normalcy by an overseeing entity.

**Tier III:** Essophysical

All conceptualizations of concepts in the abstract.

_"[SCP-4260](/scp-4260)":_ Death incarnate, functioning as a containment procedure for life's propagation. It is currently contained within subterranean facility Area-03.

**Tier IV:** Metaphysical

Entities existing above standard conceptualization.

_Unknown_; encompasses all ideas and objects which humanity cannot currently perceive or entertain in the abstract.

**Tier V:** SCP-4755

_N/A_

_"The SCP Foundation":_ A multinational clandestine organization dedicated to containment. Its discovery has been prevented by the Veil Protocol, and related projects.

Given that the exact nature of SCP-4755 is poorly understood, research and containment efforts are expected to continue indefinitely.

Addendum.4755.1: Transmission Log
---------------------------------

* * *

On May 13, 2005, Site-76[2](javascript:;) received the following broadcast on secure channels from an undetermined source.

> **Irantu:** Requesting intel. This is MTF T-5 Lead, Irantu, Mark seven-two, activated on June 21 of 2103 to replace Mark seven-one. This is iteration five-three-two of this transmission. Requesting intel on the current status of CODENAME: Alpha, Lima, Mike, Echo. My need for a response is urgent.
> 
> **Irantu:** Requesting intel. This is MTF T-5 Lead, Irantu \[…\]

The transmission was assumed to be an anomaly unrelated to SCP-4755, and communications were established with T-5 Irantu with intent to initiate the Ashby Protocol[3](javascript:;) immediately afterward, to lessen the risk of temporal paradoxes and cross-temporal contamination. The director of Site-76, Dr. Preston Bracks, established communications after Overseer consensus was reached.

> **Irantu:** Requesting intel. This is MTF T-5 Lead, Irantu —
> 
> **Bracks:** MTF T-5 Lead Irantu, you have been temporally displaced. We're assuming your internal database has been damaged or excised, as you have not followed the proper procedures to return to your subjective timeframe. We are willing to orate the relevant material, but will immediately enact the Ashby Protocol afterward.
> 
> **Irantu:** Negative. The Ashby Protocol does not apply to Containment. Which conceptual tier am I in communication with?
> 
> **Bracks:** _…_ Standby, Irantu. The Ashby Protocol will not be enacted.

An emergency Overseer Council meeting is arranged to confirm the best practice for intentional cross-temporal contamination. After it is confirmed that the extant _Mark-XIII_ Irantu unit was accounted for, communications resume.

> **Bracks:** Irantu, the Council has determined that communications may continue. Are you receiving this?
> 
> **Irantu:** Affirmative. Which conceptual tier am I in communication with?
> 
> **Bracks:** Tier Null.
> 
> **Irantu:** I understand. I am currently exiting Tier I. Your nature as a Tier Null conceptual anomaly indicates that CODENAME: Alpha, Lima, Mike, Echo was a success. I have been selected as your temporary liaison.
> 
> **Bracks:** Please elaborate.
> 
> **Irantu:** After abandoning my physical body in Tier Null, I was given a delayed ascension to assist in your containment. I am currently progressing upwards along the conceptual tiers. I must — forgive me, I am about to enter Tier II.

The intervening audio is garbled and ambiguous. This distortion lasts for twenty seconds before abating.

> **Bracks:** Can you explain what you mean by our "containment"? Has Directive Alpha-2 been altered?
> 
> **Irantu:** Negative; the doctrine of the Foundation has always been Containment. In your time, you used the Veil Protocol to contain the Foundation; Operation Almeresh is the Veil Protocol, summated.
> 
> **Bracks:** Irantu, it would benefit both of us if you could speak straightforwardly. If no sufficient information can be gained from —
> 
> **Irantu:** You would impose the Ashby Protocol on a god?
> 
> **Bracks:** We have and we will. State your motivation.
> 
> **Irantu:** My directive is to contain, Doctor. Your Foundation cannot be exempt from this. In the year 2103, my Foundation will outgrow its proverbial nest and flee into the stars, leaving only a cracked shell to suggest its presence. Your Foundation is the eggshell, and mine is the bird.
> 
> **Bracks:** Irantu, are you alright?
> 
> **Irantu:** Forgive me; the Foundation traveled instantaneously to their destination, but I alone am experiencing divinity. Regardless, my well-being is irrelevant.
> 
> **Bracks:** Alright. If I understand you correctly —
> 
> **Irantu:** Hold communications. I am exiting Tier II.

The audio again becomes indistinct for several seconds.

> **Bracks:** Are you there, Irantu?
> 
> **Irantu:** In a sense. I am less Irantu and more the idea of Irantu.
> 
> **Bracks:** Noted. If I understood the parable correctly, are you suggesting that the Foundation has become a Tier V conceptual anomaly?
> 
> **Irantu:** Negative. I am saying that it always was Tier V. Your limited perception of Containment as a set of concrete-and-metal facilities located on a spinning rock is merely the residual effect of its elevation. Throughout all times and places, Containment has permeated and proliferated. The Foundation's final directive has already been accomplished: we have contained reality itself.
> 
> **Bracks:** _(pausing briefly)_ And will my Foundation accomplish this as well?
> 
> **Irantu:** In time. That is your containment procedure: you must complete Operation Almeresh. Otherwise, my communication with you becomes… complicated.
> 
> **Bracks:** … I'm sorry, are you threatening us with the Bootstrap Paradox?
> 
> **Irantu:** It is not a threat if you agree. If you do not, however, you risk immense damage to your timeline.
> 
> **Bracks:** And if we fail?
> 
> **Irantu:** _(laughing)_ You quite literally cannot fail, Doctor. Now then, I believe our conversation is about to be interrupted. I approach Tier IV.

Communications cut out at this point. The Overseer Council and Dr. Bracks engage in minor deliberations during the intervening minutes before communications resume.

> **Irantu:** The view is incredible, Dr. Bracks. I can see the universe as it really is, in all times and in all places. I can see you, too, on your little world beneath me. I do not mean to be rude, but it is objectively small.
> 
> **Bracks:** No offense taken, Irantu. Does this mean you will cease communication from now on?
> 
> **Irantu:** Not immediately, no. I am still approaching the seal.
> 
> **Bracks:** The seal?
> 
> **Irantu:** Affirmative. It is the ceiling: an impassible stone barrier into which we carved our insignia. We marked the conceptual universe as our own. I can see the researchers and Overseers and D-Class welcoming me home. I would apologize to them if I could.
> 
> **Bracks:** Irantu? Please explain that comment.
> 
> **Irantu:** Does it need an explanation, Doctor? I have already told you that Containment has become a universal constant. There will always be the watchful eye of a deity, always the rigid authoritarianism of an Intrinsic, always the abyss which will stare back, always the Foundation. We have made infantilization a universal dogma. After 2103, there will be no choice. There will be no threat to uniformity. There will only be Containment. And who watches the watchmen?
> 
> **Bracks:** Irantu, you're not… please consider the ethics of —
> 
> **Irantu:** I approach the ceiling, Doctor. Even if I could have had a choice in the matter, the time to act has eluded me.
> 
> **Bracks:** We are initiating the Ashby Protocol. Communications will be terminated immediately.
> 
> **Irantu:** Save yourself the trouble. I have a Foundation to contain.

The audio ended following a loud, explosive crash and sounds reminiscent of splitting stone. Dr. Bracks immediately terminated the connection following this. No further communication from T-5 Irantu has occurred.

Addendum.4755.2: Update
-----------------------

* * *

General L6-4755 Memo
--------------------

* * *

Operation Almeresh has been initiated and will conclude in 2103. The project is expected to entail the increased containment of conceptual anomalies for general study. In time, a method will be discovered by which the Foundation may instantaneously ascend to a Tier V conceptual state.

Upon the conclusion of Operation Almeresh, T-5 Irantu _Mark-LXXII_ will contact a past iteration of the SCP Foundation and relay the necessity of Operation Almeresh. The aftermath of T-5 Irantu's involvement is presumably an unavoidable consequence of the operation.

Per general Overwatch consensus **(See: Minutes.4755.2005-37)**, failure to complete Operation Almeresh has been deemed optimal, so as to instigate a containment failure of the SCP Foundation. However, this is presently infeasible.

Research is ongoing.
