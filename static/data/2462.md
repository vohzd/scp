SCP-2462

**Item #:** SCP-2462

**Object Class:** Euclid Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the restrictive growing conditions of _Rafflesia arnoldii_, Outpost 2462-0 has been established at SCP-2462's location of discovery to prevent unauthorized access and allow for experimentation. Monetary compensation to the citizens of ██████ has been authorized to prevent the disclosure of SCP-2462's anomalous properties to third parties. A 350m perimeter is to be established around SCP-2462 during its blooming period, with access denied to all unauthorized individuals, save for citizens of ██████ who live, work, or regularly visit inside the perimeter.

SCP-2462 is kept at Outpost 2462-0. Four mirrors are to be stationed around SCP-2462, and must be cleaned regularly to maintain reflectivity.

**Description:** SCP-2462 is a genetically unremarkable specimen of _Rafflesia arnoldii_ located outside ██████, Indonesia. While blooming, SCP-2462 generates a variable number of illusory _R. arnoldii_ instances, collectively designated SCP-2462-A, within 250 meters of itself.

SCP-2462-A do not displace any matter or have mass of their own, yet are opaque to light and respond realistically to environmental stimuli and physical interaction. Computer analysis of photographed SCP-2462-A has confirmed that they are not hallucinations.

The number of SCP-2462-A is variable. In its natural environment, SCP-2462 would maintain an average of 30,000 SCP-2462-A[1](javascript:;) under normal circumstances. The following factors are known to affect SCP-2462-A production:

*   Proximity of other _R. arnoldii_: Each living specimen within line of sight of SCP-2462 results in a ~60% reduction in SCP-2462-A's numbers.
*   Malnourishment: SCP-2462-A production increases by 20-50% in periods where SCP-2462 is malnourished.
*   Light: When illumination of SCP-2462 drops below levels typical of nighttime in its natural environment, SCP-2462-A will triple in number, receding when illumination is restored.
*   Damage: When SCP-2462 is damaged, SCP-2462-A will cover almost every surface within 250 meters of it. SCP-2462-A will recede only when the damage to SCP-2462 is healed.

Due to the difficulty of locating and transporting _R. arnoldii_ instances[2](javascript:;), containment by the presentation of other _R. arnoldii_ instances is impracticable.

**Recovery:** SCP-2462 was identified in 2008, after photographs of SCP-2462-A were published on the official ██████ tourism website. Interviews with citizens of ██████ indicate that SCP-2462 has been exhibiting anomalous properties since the previous year, with SCP-2462-A affecting two neighborhoods on the town's outskirts. Turning SCP-2462-A into a tourist attraction had only been considered in the months preceding SCP-2462's 2008 bloom.

**Addendum:** At the recommendation of Dr. Breitkopf, SCP-2462 was surrounded by four mirrors, producing an effectively unlimited number of reflections, during a blooming period. SCP-2462-A was not generated. SCP-2462 was downgraded to Safe, and containment procedures were adjusted accordingly.

[1](javascript:;). Roughly one per 6.5m2 over its whole active radius.

[2](javascript:;). _R. arnoldii_ exists as a parasite on the roots of the _Tetrastigma_ genus, and has not been successfully cultivated in captivity. It is not visible to the naked eye outside of its brief annual blooming period. Moreover, _R. arnoldii_ is critically endangered due to deforestation — SCP-2462 is the only known member of its species within a 36km radius.
