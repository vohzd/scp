**Item #:** SCP-2753

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot ([I/O-SILVER](/scp-3089)) is to monitor internet traffic for SCP-2753. Upon discovery, all data containing SCP-2753 is to be destroyed. Anyone outside of Foundation personnel aware of SCP-2753 is to be apprehended, interrogated, and amnesticized.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are to be kept disassembled in a secure locker on-site. Instances of SCP-2753-B and SCP-2753-C are to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Tests are prohibited at this time.

**Description:** SCP-2753 is a 3 dimensional ratio that can be used to describe the relationship between the sides of a block.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are blocks which match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and material. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar size and material are assembled into a standard Jenga[1](javascript:;) tower: If this tower collapses, any structure containing it will immediately collapse with it.

Since 2009, the growing popularity and accuracy of 3D printing combined with SCP-2753's presentation within OBJ files[2](javascript:;) as a printable Jenga set has led to 21 structural collapses, 35 injuries, and 14 deaths.

> The collapse of a warehouse used to host the Boston Anomalous Art Expo[3](javascript:;) was linked to an instance of SCP-2753-A. 14 additional anomalous objects (including [SCP-1433](/scp-1433), an instance of [SCP-1617](/scp-1617), and [SCP-████](/project-proposal-1994-103)) were also recovered amidst the wreckage. The collapse left over 49 participants injured and 21 dead. The following note was discovered nearby:

> Based on information provided by an undisclosed source, the Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) was used to search for SCP-2753 projections in financial market data. The collapse of several investment firms and multi-level marketing[4](javascript:;) companies were unexpectedly linked to SCP-2753.
> 
> Further investigation has demonstrated the existence of SCP-2753-B instances. Instances are financial assets that match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any value and type. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar value and type are assembled into an interdependent network: If this network loses solvency, any corporate entity linked to it will experience an immediate catastrophic financial collapse.
> 
> Foundation efforts are currently underway to discover all such networks and safely disassemble them.

Several significant server crashes along with losses of critical data were linked to SCP-2753.
> 
> Further investigation has demonstrated the existence of SCP-2753-C instances. Instances are files with specific attributes matching SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and type. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar size and type are accessed simultaneously by a single program. If this program crashes unexpectedly, any network running this program will experience an immediate catastrophic failure.

> Foundation efforts are currently underway to discover all such programs and destroy them.
