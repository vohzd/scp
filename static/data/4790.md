[F.A.Q.](http://www.scp-wiki.net/component:info-ayers)

ITEM NUMBER: SCP-4790

LEVEL 4/4790

CONTAINMENT CLASS: PENDING

EXTRASOLAR

* * *

![Alpha-Centauri.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4790/Alpha-Centauri.jpg)

Alpha Centauri A and B photographed by the ESA (with the Hubble Space Telescope) and NASA.

* * *

Special Containment Procedures: Scientific consensus on Alpha Centauri B is to be falsified and mainstream publications altered, to explain its abnormal properties as the product of non-anomalous magnetic field disturbance. Theories on the possibility of extraterrestrial life emerging at Alpha Centauri are to be met with extreme skepticism and discredited where possible.

* * *

Description: SCP-4790 refers to a series of abnormal phenomena associated with Alpha Centauri B (also known as "Toliman"), a star located 4.37 light-years from Earth.

Initial Hubble observation detected a field of irregular gravitational activity surrounding Toliman with a radius of 5.1 to 16 Astronomical Units.[1](javascript:;) Objects within this range disobey causal laws, regularly exhibiting random fluctuations in size, composition, velocity, and ontology. In all instances, objects in Toliman's stellar neighbourhood become trapped at the edge of an unexpectedly powerful gravity well, forming a ~0.05 AU-thick debris field around the star at a radius of 0.9 AU.

Mainstream astronomers assert that 45% of debris corresponds with the unexplained destruction of speculated Earth-sized exoplanet **α Cen B_b_**. In a study population of 2,700 civilian and Foundation researchers attached to the observation of Toliman, 83% tested positive for cognitohazard infection and expressed considerable distress toward their findings.

Autonomous satellite _Chekhov-.009_ departed[2](javascript:;) on its maiden voyage to study Toliman with advanced para-technologies — including onboard [Artificially Intelligent Conscript](/aiad-homescreen) Fledgling.aic.

_Chekhov-.009_ arrived near Toliman on July 11, 2020 and made confirmation of the debris field. Fledgling.aic immediately detected an unexpected 1,420 MHz signal burst. The signal was filtered automatically via counter-cognitohazard algorithms before its contents could be translated. Fledgling.aic launched a monitoring probe on a vector to the signal's source.

Located at the source was a vessel built according to a previously documented _Priorihominus_[3](javascript:;) design, displaying the outward shape of an enclosed [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle). Entering the vessel, the probe encountered an internal environment containing extensive hydroponics, cryogenics, and habitation spaces, suggesting its purpose as a generation ship.

Upon closer inspection, the probe was unable to find any signs of life, including microbial. This information, in addition to the discovery of empty data cores, suggests that the vessel has not been inhabited at any point.

Soon after, the probe's audiovisual feed experienced disruption and broadcast images of pervasive purple light, strong visual static, and several layers of indecipherable audio. This broadcast persists despite all attempts at powering down the probe, which cannot be recovered.

Since first receiving the transmission, Fledgling.aic reports experiencing tactile sensations of fluttering in the abdomen — a symptom of human anxiety — despite lacking a physical body. Fledgling.aic also notes feelings of regret and general dread toward the state of the Alpha Centauri system. It requested to leave.[4](javascript:;)

Fledgling.aic detected 160 other space-faring vessels trapped in the debris field. All vessels are of similar fabrication, suggesting each vessel is a generation ship from the same extrasolar location.

All attempts at hailing these vessels have resulted in failure.

▷: ACCESSING UPDATE

UPDATED CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES

> The Alpha Centauri system is under quarantine. Travel within 600 AU of Alpha Centauri AB is suspended on an indefinite basis.
> 
> Fledgling.aic is to transmit its findings to Extrasolar Activities Monitoring Station Erebus-07, located on Luna, at which point all data will be seized. All associated personnel are to be amnesticized and transferred.
> 
> Pursuant to Artificially Intelligent Conscript Standard Principle, Fledgling.aic must undergo expungement of all _Chekhov-.009_ systems and begin immediate and indefinite cessation of activity.

SUBJECT: _CHEKHOV-.009_ FINDINGS

Alongside the evident destruction to Alpha Centauri B — worse than we feared — Fledgling.aic detected a signal emitting from within a space-faring vessel (code-name: IANTHINE HERALD). The signal contained the following information:

\[INFORMATION EXPUNGED — SEE ATTACHMENTS\]

By order of the O5, all communications data on-board _Chekhov-.009_ has been expunged from reality. Projections on the historical size of the _Priorihominus_ sphere of influence are to be reassessed.

The Minotaur has escaped the Labyrinth.

Whether they faced it head-on or have merely gone into hiding.

It does not matter.

We must remain ever vigilant.
