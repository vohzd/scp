**Item #:** SCP-2571

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-MANDELA) is to monitor online communities for discussions regarding SCP-2571. MTF Phi-7 ("The Laughingstock") is to investigate these discussions and make a determination for appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.

**Description:** SCP-2571 is a recurring childhood memory of a non-existent theme-park ('Cragglewood Park'). It is estimated that 0.05% of the world's population is affected by SCP-2571; however, recent evidence suggests this number may be growing. The primary vector for SCP-2571's spread is not yet known — notably, it appears to be most common among adults raised as an only child.

Afflicted subjects are initially responsive to amnestics, but memories regarding Cragglewood will typically resurface once treatment ceases. Although descriptions of these memories vary, several details remain consistent:

*   Subjects were between the age of 4 and 12 when they visited.
*   The park featured numerous characters, primarily centered around anthropomorphic variants of trees and plants.
*   No adult supervision was present.
*   Calliope music played throughout the park.
*   Subjects attended the park with numerous other children, none of whom they knew.
*   The park featured only one ride; a carousel (or 'merry-go-round'). Although children accompanying the subjects boarded this ride, the subjects themselves did not.

Investigations regarding the precise nature of both SCP-2571 and Cragglewood Park are ongoing.

> **\[**BEGIN LOG.**\]**
> 
> **REINER:** What do you recall about 'Cragglewood Park'?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Jesus. Is that what this is about? It's just this nightmare I used to have.
> 
> **REINER:** Can you elaborate?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** I mean, I think it's — it's probably based on some actual theme-park I went to as a little kid, y'know? Probably traumatized the shit out of me.
> 
> **REINER:** What happens in the nightmare?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** I enter this theme-park. It's like Disneyland, but smaller. There's no rides; just this long, winding road through the woods. Everything's bright and colorful, like in a cartoon. And there's these trees all around me, but…
> 
> **REINER:** Tell me about the trees.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** They've all got faces. And they're singing. They've got these dopey, cheerful looks, like in one of those old time cartoons, right? And they just sing and laugh and sing.
> 
> **REINER:** Can you tell me anything else?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** There's this music that's playing everywhere. It's like organ music, but not the kind you hear in a church. More like the sort you might hear in a carnival.
> 
> **REINER:** You mentioned before that there aren't any rides.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Uh, no, wait. No, I'm wrong. There's rides — there's one ride. Just one ride. It's that thing with horses that goes around in circles. You know what I'm talking about?
> 
> **REINER:** A carousel.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Right. That thing. It's where the organ music is coming from.
> 
> **REINER:** Were you there alone?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** No. There's other kids with me. They're not happy to be there, either. We're all smiling and laughing, but we're just doing it to stop ourselves from crying, y'know? To fool the trees. So the trees don't see how scared we are. To keep the trees happy.
> 
> **REINER:** Keep them happy?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Yeah.
> 
> **REINER:** Is there anything else you can tell us?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Um, fuck. I don't know. I haven't dreamed about this place in ages. Uh, I think… There's one bit, near the end.
> 
> **REINER:** Please, relax. Take as much time as you need.
> 
> **\[**_Subject closes his eyes._**\]**
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Just as I'm getting ready to leave, I see something. A tiny tree, sprouting up near my foot. It looks up at me. It's smiling, smiling with that big, dopey, happy grin. When I see it, that's when I start screaming. That's when I wake up.
> 
> **REINER:** Why does that tree make you scream?
> 
> **\[**_Subject opens his eyes._**\]**
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Because it has my face.

> 
> **SUBJECT:** What? Hell no. Are you crazy?
> 
> **REINER:** What happened when you reached it, then?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** Some of the kids got on. Not me, though. The ones who did — some of them were smiling, some of them were crying. Some of them hugged the ones who didn't get on. Some of them hugged each other.
> 
> **REINER:** What happened then?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** They rode the carousel. Then we left.
> 
> **REINER:** What happened to them?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** (_irritated_) How should I know? We left.

> **REINER:** You left them behind?
> 
> **SUBJECT:** (_increasingly irritated_) Yes, we left them behind. What, you think we should have stuck around? See how this was all going to turn out?
> 
> **REINER:** I'm sorry. I didn't mean to accuse you of anything. You were just a child. No one would have expected you to—

> **\[**_Subject lowers head into hands._**\]**
