SCP-3128.

**Item #:** SCP-3128

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3128 is to be kept in a secured locker on-site. Access is limited to Level-4 personnel; following Incident 3128-073, testing is prohibited.

MTF Iota-10 ("Damn Feds") is to work with law enforcement personnel to investigate the whereabouts of PoI-3128-1. If found, she is to be apprehended and taken into Foundation custody.

**Description:** SCP-3128 is a near-complete Monopólio[1](javascript:;) game-set originally produced in Portugal at some point in 1937. When played, it exerts an anomalous effect upon global real estate markets; events in reality will mirror events in the game. Following the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007, all further tests by researchers involving manipulation of real estate markets via game-play have been suspended.

Following Incident 3128-073, all testing is suspended pending review.
