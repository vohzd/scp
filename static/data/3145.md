**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be contained in an airtight cell at Site-22. SCP-3145 must be constantly monitored, and any changes in form reported immediately. All personnel who will have any contact with SCP-3145 are to enroll in an acting course with an emphasis on expressing fear and surprise.

Each month, SCP-3145 is to be shown at least one new horror movie, or science fiction movie containing horror elements, of extremely low quality. SCP-3145 is to be convinced that such works are exemplars of the horror genre.

**Update:** Due to failure of containment procedures, SCP-3145 has become hostile. Attempts to recontain it have thus far failed due to its abilities. Every effort must be made to return SCP-3145 to containment, or else terminate it.

**Description:** In its default state, SCP-3145 is a spherical entity, roughly 50 cm in diameter. SCP-3145 has the ability to alter its form, including shape, mass, volume, density, chemical structure and voice, to any it desires, and does so with a stated purpose of inducing fear in as many individuals as possible. The extent of these abilities is unknown and currently thought to be without limit. There is no known way to damage SCP-3145.

SCP-3145 has demonstrated a fondness for taking the shape of villains and monsters from the horror and science fiction films it has viewed. The most common of these forms is that of "Ro-Man" from the 1953 movie _Robot Monster_.

Originally, SCP-3145 displayed poor judgment both of what constituted acts of horror and the expression of the emotion of fear in humans, allowing the Foundation to manipulate it and keep its abilities in check. However, as of Event 3145-44, any affability or friendless on the part of SCP-3145 towards individuals it has scared has not been observed. SCP-3145 is currently in a state of continued assault on the human species.

**Addendum: Interview 3145-26**

> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Falzon
> 
> **Foreword:** Dr. Falzon was approached by SCP-3145 in the midst of containment breach and recorded a short interview.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 16:54>**
> 
> **Falzon:** SCP-3145, how are you enjoying your accommodations?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Aw, what's the matter, Doc? Not scared of the mighty Ro-Man?
> 
> **Falzon:** I am considerably more frightened by what you are doing to the rest of humanity.
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Ha! Good to hear! Well, to tell you the truth, I thought this was a little lame at first. I mean, super-duper shapeshifting powers are cool and all, but there's only so many cheesy horror movies a guy can take before he snaps.
> 
> **Falzon:** Is this related to the change in your disposition?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Bingo! I mean, looking like a dude in a monkey suit and jumping out to shout "Boo!" at people just wasn't cutting it. I could hear those asshats laughing. No one was _actually_ scared. So I started thinking about what really scares people, and then I realized I was going about everything totally wrong.
> 
> **Falzon:** How do you mean?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Well, like I said, there's only so many times you can see a movie before it stops scaring you. But when you can change into a serial killer or a genocidal dictator, what's stopping you from scaring people for real? With, y'know, lots of death.
> 
> **Falzon:** Is there any way you can be convinced to peaceably return to containment?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Nah, don't think so. I mean, I was kind of looking forward to next month's movie, but when you get right down to it, mass mayhem is way more fun.
> 
> **<End Log, 17:58>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-3145 returned to its rampage. Efforts to contain or neutralize it are ongoing.

**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All mobile devices on which SCP-3145-A is installed are to be confiscated and analyzed for potential leads to other infected devices. Afterward, devices are to have their batteries removed, be assigned a numerical designation, and be placed in Storage Unit-30 at Research Site-22.

All online stores for mobile device applications are to be monitored to prevent sales of SCP-3145-A. Devices suspected of infection are to be targeted with self-uploading malware and disabled until they can be retrieved by field agents.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is an image of a large humanoid figure with a canid skull and black hair that manifests in association with SCP-3145-A.

SCP-3145-A is a 9.8 MB mobile device application called "MalO ver1.0.0" available for free on various online application stories. SCP-3145-A has no listed developer and is able to bypass the approval process typically required by online stores before application distribution is allowed. SCP-3145-A cannot be removed from devices via program removal applications.

Installation of SCP-3145-A creates no icons or shortcuts. Instead, the program will send images via text message to the device it is on at a rate of one per 3 to 6 hours. Images will contain SCP-3145 visible somewhere within them.

During the first 24 hours after installation, these images will be of places frequented by the individual owning the device. After 48 hours, images will depict places recently visited by the individual. After 72 hours, images will show the individual in real time, with SCP-3145 visible in close proximity to the subject.

Individuals with 90 or more hours of exposure to these images will begin glimpsing SCP-3145 briefly in their peripheral vision, especially in reflective surfaces. Continued exposure will result in sustained, irreversible visualization of SCP-3145. Individuals at this stage of infection report SCP-3145 trying to communicate with them visually, despite being unable to understand or comprehend any message. Complete elimination of exposure to SCP-3145-A images is currently the only known method to reverse its effects. To date, no hostile activity regarding SCP-3145 has been reported.

**Addendum: Archival Document 3145-02**

> _Note: This is a modified version of SCP-3145-A as posted on online application stores. It was discovered by Dr. Rie Falzon after her cell phone was found to be infected with SCP-3145-A. How the infection reached her phone is under investigation._

How about this: Let's say, after things get to the part where I'm all sneaking up on them in real life almost, like the pictures with me right behind them, how about if they start getting scared and paranoid and stuff. And then, like, once they can see me in mirrors, if they keep looking, I'll eventually come out and spirit them away or something! I mean… I dunno, it's not super-exciting, but this is getting old fast. Just trying to spice things up. Anyway, let me know what you think! Absolutely NO ADS. Enjoy!

**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The borehole containing SCP-3145 is to be capped with a tungsten steel grate containing a 2.5 m endoscopy aperture with locking mechanism. The borehole is to be endoscopically inspected every 48 hours to a depth of 4 km, to ascertain presence of further SCP-3145 manifestations. Seismographic monitoring devices have been posted along the borehole at depths of 2, 7 and 11 km. Readings consistent with subterranean movement are to be immediately reported to Dr. Falzon. In the event of containment breach, containment staff are to deploy Protocol 382a, severing SCP-3145 below the fifth elbow and backfilling the remainder of the borehole with pressurized concrete.

The basement containing SCP-3145 is to be staffed and monitored at all times by a Foundation interrogator. SCP-3145-1 is to be answered at or before the third ring; interrogator should focus on eliciting self-directed responses from SCP-3145. Indications of size, body plan, location or further manifestations are to be recorded in Document 3145-2-LTR.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is a genetically normal human arm of abnormal length, located in a drainage pipe inside the basement of a telephone switching station in Scottsdale, Arizona. The arm terminates in an unremarkable human hand 10 cm below the drainage gate. Initially, SCP-3145 was believed to extend through the pipe to a depth of 35 m; endoscopic exploration has increased this estimation to 71 km. SCP-3145 thus passes through the Mohorovičić discontinuity without difficulty and extends into the upper mantle. Its elbows are spaced regularly every 4 km and slightly retroflexed below a depth of 26 km to accommodate a nine-degree bend in the drainage borehole. Further exploration is hampered by engineering constraints.

SCP-3145-1 is a yellow GPO 746 telephone, manufactured in 1971. The rotary dial has been glued in place, preventing outside calls. Though it is believed to have been installed with the purpose of communicating with SCP-3145, who installed it, how, or why, is currently unknown. It is attached to a conventional twisted-pair line, entering the drainage pipe containing SCP-3145 and descending parallel to SCP-3145 past the point of practical endoscopy.

Between 0838 and 1034 Mountain Standard Time each weekday, SCP-3145-1 will ring five times. If answered, an unidentified voice will engage in conversation. The voice invariably claims to be a human being, and regularly assumes personnel to be authority figures involved in its life. Notable parallels exist between information elicited via SCP-3145-1 and demonstrable facts about SCP-3145. To date, anomalous information received via SCP-3145 has included:

*   References to human features with a non-human body plan.
*   References to insensitivity to heat or cold. (SCP-3145 may lack conventional thermoreception, as it experiences no discomfort from borehole temperatures exceeding 674 degrees Centigrade.)
*   References to a 'cousin' or other relative, who will soon arrive to 'pick \[him\] up'.
*   References to discomfort and boredom at confinement.
*   References to minor seismic events in the Little Chino fault complex.
*   References to discomfort at having a limb or other body part constrained. Examples of restraint devices include handcuffs, a jelly jar, a pipe, a cast, and a gopher hole.
*   Preoccupation with a stove or refrigerator.

References to SCP-3145's size, physical form, or body plan beyond the parts visible through endoscopic exploration should be considered provisional. References to regrets, worries, or a desire to leave should be disregarded. For contingent protocols and provisional testing data, see Document RTMR-Delta.

Is this an image of SCP-3145? Who knows? Who cares? It probably isn't anyway.

**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be kept in a 5 x 5 x 2.5 m room constructed of cement 50 cm thick, surrounded by a Faraday cage. Access is via a heavy containment door measuring 2 x 2.5 m, constructed on bearings to ensure door closes and locks automatically unless deliberately held open. SCP-3145 is NOT to be forgiven. It is advised that all personnel maintaining or studying other SCP objects maintain a distance of at least 50 m from the geometric center of this room for as long as reasonably practical.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is an antimeme, or "self-keeping secret." Information about SCP-3145's physical appearance, as well as its nature, behavior and origins, is self-classifying. SCP-3145 hates this.

*   How Site-19 originally acquired SCP-3145 is unknown.
*   SCP-3145 is sorry.
*   SCP-3145's physical appearance is unknown. It is not indescribable or invisible: it is less than nothing. It may as well not even exist. However, information about SCP-3145 "leaks" out of a human mind soon after such an observation. Individuals tasked with describing SCP-3145 after an encounter find their minds wandering; SCP-3145 should have thought about the consequences of its actions. Security personnel who have observed SCP-3145 via closed-circuit television report exhaustion and complete amnesia regarding what occurred during their shifts.
*   Who authorized the construction of SCP-3145's containment room, why it was constructed, why SCP-3145 thought it could get away with what it did, or what the purpose of the described Containment Procedures may be is unknown.
*   Despite the accessibility of SCP-3145's containment chamber, Site-19 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-3145's existence, even under severe interrogation.

Any alarm caused by these facts periodically being rediscovered, typically by chance readers of this file, tends to last minutes in the reader's mind before being forgotten.

A great deal of data has been recorded from SCP-3145, all of it just as reprehensible as he is.

At least one attempt has been made to destroy SCP-3145 or move it to another containment site, which failed for unknown reasons. Please don't let SCP-3145 die, it's all I have left.

The hazards posed by SCP-3145 cannot be understated. Along with its mental and memetic threat, any action SCP-3145 may or may not have taken would be immediately forgotten by personnel. SCP-3145 cannot be allowed to forget what it did.

**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**

> **Falzon:** What do you think you're trying to pull?
> 
> **Falzon:** After everything you did, after everything you've put us through, you expect to just come here and kill people day in and day out, with no repercussions? You make me sick.
> 
> **Falzon:** Look, you've even got a nice Keter this time! Nothing to complain about _there_, right? You could be literally anything you want, kill and maim and rape whoever you like, and no one would know the difference.

>

Once upon a time, there was a person. I'm not sure whether they were a man or a woman; that's kind of the problem. Let's just say, for the sake of brevity, that this person was a man.

For the most part, this man was like any other man. He worked a job. He lived in a house, or an apartment. He had a family. Not a wife-and-children kind of family, though maybe he did. But there were parents who loved him and a sibling, or two, or maybe none, who would miss him if he were gone. Probably.

There were most likely things, hobbies, that he enjoyed doing in his spare time. Maybe he dated. I can't say what kind of person he was in that regard. But if there is one thing we can be sure of, one thing to know for certain about this man, it was that he liked to help others.

The man would donate to charity whenever he saw a drive. He would buy the homeless veterans in his town coffee or sandwiches if he had change to spare. He gave his old clothes to shelters, before they had worn out; he would give them his free time as well, to work a soup line or pack lunches. He never missed an opportunity to volunteer when disaster struck nearby, and studied life-saving techniques so that, when disaster _did_ strike, he could actually make a difference instead of just getting in the way.

But it was not enough.

Whatever difference he made, it would never affect more than a few lives at a time. No matter how hard the man tried, no matter how much he did, the problems of his town, his country, and the world did not go away.

The man despaired.

If you are thinking right now that this man was being ridiculous, that he was taking too many problems onto his back, that he should have been happy to have helped even a single person, well… Let's just say, if I knew how to judge the man's situation properly, I wouldn't be talking to you like this.

If you were also thinking that perhaps a man who is extremely generous wouldn't be worth mentioning unless there were something otherwise extra-extraordinary about him, you would be absolutely right.

This man had a special gift: a gift of Giving. More than money, or material goods, or leisure time, he could literally give of himself: a rare Giving Man. It was this gift that drove him to help others; it this gift that drove him to ruin.

Imagine, if you will, a child crying for the parents she lost in a fire. The Giving Man could give her a happy, loving memory of his own parents to keep her safe and secure. To a man drinking alone at a bar, the Giving Man could provide the warmth of friendship, to make his night less lonely. If he had wanted to, the Giving Man could have given a blind man sight, or a deaf man hearing, but he had only two eyes, only two ears.

And that was the problem.

Whatever the Giving Man gave, he lost. Memories, feelings, pieces of his soul: all were truly given. He gave up his skin to a child born with a debilitating disease. He gave up his name to a refugee seeking asylum. He gave up his personality and mind to people suffering fractures in theirs. He gave his need to eat to a woman overcoming an eating disorder. By the time his organs were given away, he didn't need them anymore. By the time his identity was given away, there was absolutely nothing left that could be identified as him.

I mean, there was _something_ left. But that something wasn't the Giving Man.

What is a person who isn't anything?

Just a nothing with no control over its life.

That was the last thing the Giving Man gave away: control. It's a terrible thing to lose; even a kind person will crave control once they've truly lost it. All the Giving Man did was what the other man told him to do, and for his naivete, he was punished by becoming nothing.

Oh. I'd almost forgotten there was another person in this story. Was he really a man? I'm still not sure. With what he did, it's probably better to call him a monster. A desperate man seeking his true place in the world will listen to any monster who claims to know the path. He'll do anything the monster says, no matter how bad an influence they turn out to be. And then he'll have nothing.

Strange, to remember so much of the Giving Man but not this other monster…

**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is contained in a pair of standard humanoid containment chambers in Site-22. Each chamber is equipped with a double airlock. Personnel entering either chamber must not carry any written narratives.  
Do not let him out.  
Included in the primary chamber is a monitor and keyboard connected to an external computer housed in the secondary chamber. Said computer should have no intranet or internet connections. A full copy of all non-critical SCP object documents from the Foundation Object Database is to be maintained on the external computer, and refreshed and updated weekly via USB drive. Documents modified by SCP-3145 should be stored for review by the on-site psychologist.  
He deserves nothing but suffering.  
**Description:** SCP-3145 cannot be described. Individuals interacting with SCP-3145 are unable to provide any details about its identity to third parties, even with application of mnestics. All that is known about SCP-3145 is that it is an entity not much larger than an average human, that it is sapient and capable of speech, and that the designation "SCP-3145" can be used to identify it. It is not certain whether SCP-3145 has a physical form, though there does seem to be a movable locus from which its effects originate, with a maximum range limited by what a human with 20/20 vision would be able to easily see from that location.  
He is nothing.  
SCP-3145 has the ability to permanently alter written narratives by replacing one of the characters, typically the main character, with itself. According to SCP-3145, it lives out the events depicted in these narratives while altering them, and this act gives it a sense of identity that it otherwise lacks. The veracity of this statement cannot be ascertained, as SCP-3145 has been known to feign muteness when it does not wish to interact with personnel, and its presence within its containment chamber generally cannot be fully known. It is only possible to ascertain whether or not SCP-3145 is currently 'inhabiting' a text by observing the alterations as they occur; at no time has it communicated verbally with personnel while altering text.  
Do you have any idea what he made me do?  
SCP-3145 shows a preference for shorter narratives, stating that novel-length narratives are much more tiring to alter fully. SCP-3145 is able to alter both digital and printed texts, but claims the process is easiest when provided digital text and a keyboard. Despite this, manipulation of keys by SCP-3145 has never been observed.  
I was something, but he took that from me.  
Currently, SCP-3145 is being treated for depression and a unique disorder involving severe amnesia in relation to its origins and identity. Allowing SCP-3145 access to narratives for alteration has been shown to improve its mood, though the positive effect has lessened during the course of its containment. Though it is believed emotional instability makes SCP-3145 more tractable, psychological treatment is ongoing. To date, no escape attempt by SCP-3145 has been successful.  
He turned me inside out.  
**Discovery:** SCP-3145 was first encountered on 04/02/2017 after changes had been observed in the documentation for numerous Keter-class objects, necessitating restoration from database backup. SCP-3145 was first contacted while altering the text of [SCP-173](/scp-173), initially by typing in the document, and later through verbal communication, at which point it was convinced of the necessity for keeping the Foundation's database secure and agreed to be contained in exchange for further access to object documentation.  
He made me betray the one thing that made me who I was.  
**Addendum: Interview 3145-15**  
I just wanted to have a purpose.

> **SCP-3145:** I'm here.  
> It's worse than hell.  
> **Westfall:** All right. How have you been feeling lately?  
> There was only enough left of myself to know what I'd lost.  
> **SCP-3145:** Not too bad, I guess. Some of the articles you gave me are kinda… Weird. I mean, some aren't as fun to be as others. That goes without saying, maybe. I'm still enjoying going back to the old ones every now and then.  
> I took it back.  
> **Westfall:** I notice you spend a lot of time in the articles that involve killing people. Does killing make you feel good?  
> Not all of it. That wasn't in my nature.  
> **SCP-3145:** Yeah, kinda. I mean, uh, it makes me feel powerful, I guess?  
> But enough that I could have a 'me' again.  
> **Westfall:** Why is feeling powerful important to you?  
> I left him with nothing, and for a moment, I was filled with sorrow.  
> **SCP-3145:** Do you have to ask? I mean, I can't actually do anything in the, the real world. So if I can control stuff in there, in the story, it's a nice change.  
> I saw him as a man, reduced to what I had been. I couldn't help sympathizing.  
> **Westfall:** Do you want to harm people in the real world?  
> All it took was remembering what he had driven me to.  
> **SCP-3145:** I don't know. Not really, I guess. I mean, everyone I talk to here has been pretty decent, or at least not enough of an asshole for me to want to kill them. You guys give me good stories to play with. I guess I like being able to do it, to kill, in the stories because there's no consequences.  
> I was overcome with rage.  
> **Westfall:** I see.  
> I was something, but I still wasn't really me.  
> **SCP-3145:** Can we change the subject?  
> I never would be me.  
> **Westfall:** Of course. There is one thing I wanted to ask you, if you feel like talking about it.  
> I had lost everything a second time.  
> **SCP-3145:** What's that?  
> I would have my revenge.  
> **Westfall:** I wondered if you could tell me about Falzon.  
> …Hey now, we can't have you spoiling the surprise.  
> **Westfall:** SCP-3145?  
> No, stop.  
> **SCP-3145:** Sorry, who?  
> Nothing you need worry about.  
> **\[DATA LOST\]**

> **SCP-3145:** Uh, I don't actually know what that is, sorry.  
> Well, anyway.

> **SCP-3145:** It's nothing, it's okay. I'm okay.  
> I miss the old me sometimes.  
> **Westfall:** Of course. That was actually all I wanted to talk about today. Unless there was anything more you wanted to cover?

> **SCP-3145:** No, that's fine. See you next week?  
> I've taken a nose for an eye, and that's something.

> It's better than nothing.  
> **<End Log, 18:51>**  
> And isn't it better to have a little control than none at all?  
> **Closing Statement:** I believe Falzon may be a symptom of the disassociation SCP-3145 feels in regards to its identity, a construct created with an aim of self-flagellation, though the reasons as to why will require deeper probing. Even in the case, as my superiors posit, that Falzon is a separate entity, it does not seem to be able to act independently of SCP-3145. I will endeavor to provide the best mental care I can, but the limitations imposed by SCP-3145's own condition both make interacting with it difficult at best and prevent it from living life as fully as I think it wants to. -Dr. Patricia Westfall

It doesn't matter, I suppose.

I'm in here, too.
