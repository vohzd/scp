**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3597 is to be kept in its containment chamber within Provisional Site-597. Any D-class personnel assigned to the project must also be permanently relocated inside this chamber.

Resident D-class may request supplies or additional personnel, provided no justification is given. Other than such requests, no people or coherent information may enter or leave the chamber. Two slats have been built into the structure which are used for delivery of food and waste. Any additional D-class must first be administered Grade-Z (permanent) dosages of [Class-H and Class-I amnestics](/updated-amnestics-guide).

**Description:** \[DATA EXPUNGED\]

**Recovery Log:** Foundation AICs flagged an unusual series of civilian and police deaths linked to ███ ████████ Preschool in New York, NY. [Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers")](/task-forces#pi-1) was sent in to investigate.

The building was condemned by agents within the NYC Department of Buildings and was rebuilt as Provisional Site-597. During this process a standard humanoid containment chamber was built around the former kitchen area. The site was then acquired by Foundation front company Sunny Childcare and Preschool. The special containment procedures were formalized, and Dr. Archibald declared SCP-3597 contained.

Afterwords, all personnel not inside the containment chamber were amnesticized and transferred to different projects. Guards with no knowledge of SCP-3597 except for its containment procedures were stationed within Provisional Site-597. To date there have been no breaches.
