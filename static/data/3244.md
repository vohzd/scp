Hokay. Image is from these guys: [https://www.monstersupplies.org/](https://www.monstersupplies.org/) and the photographer is Darryl Stoodley. I have email permission to use the image and can provide it in private to staff if necessary.

![SCP-3244-1-285.jpg](http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3244/SCP-3244-1-285.jpg)

Anomalous instance of SCP-3244-1

**Item #:** SCP-3244

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The house containing SCP-3244 is to be secured against outside visitors by Foundation agents. Utilizing the Foundation front company "Southern Crosscut Pines" the surrounding properties are to be purchased from their current owners in order to effect more permanent containment.

Should this purchasing process not be completed by January 1st 2019, Foundation assets in the West Haven city council are to call for the condemnation of the remaining homes under the auspices of protecting the community from sinkhole risks.

**Description:** SCP-3244 is an aperture located on the second floor of a house in West Haven, Connecticut that leads to an extra-dimensional space. This aperture is approximately .69 meters in diameter. When traversed by an individual's arm, SCP-3244 allows that individual to acquire an instance of "Mountain Dew" (hereafter identified as SCP-3244-1).

SCP-3244 is capable of producing variants of SCP-3244-1 which do not match any extant commercial product. A full listing of these variants is available in document 3244-1-K. Following 513 tests, the distribution of acquired variants is as follows:

*   Mountain Dew Code Red: 365
*   Mountain Dew (Baseline Flavor): 44
*   Bottled, clear, and unaged whiskey: 34
*   Mountain Dew Baja Blast: 31
*   Other Mountain Dew branded products (for a full listing see pages 1-3 of document 3244-1-K): 26
*   Anomalous variants of SCP-3244-1: 13

SCP-3244 was originally identified and contained on August 16th 2016. The house SCP-3244 is located in had been abandoned for 7 months by its previous owner, Toby Thompson[1](javascript:;). Mr. Thompson was last seen on January 18th 2016, approximately 9 months after the original creation of SCP-3244. A collection of communications between Mr. Thompson and his associates are collected below.

> ### Test 1:
> 
> **Date:** 9/24/16
> 
> **Directive:** Baseline test. D-8245 was directed to reach into SCP-3244 and acquire an SCP-3244-1 instance.
> 
> **Results:** D-8245 acquired an instance of "Mountain Dew Code Red"

> ### Test 56:
> 
> **Date:** 2/19/17
> 
> **Directive:** Same as baseline test, however D-8245 was directed to taste acquired instance.
> 
> **Results:** D-8245 acquired an instance of "Mountain Dew Code Red" which emitted a faint noise until D-8245 twisted and removed the cap. D-8245 mistakenly threw cap into SCP-3244 after removal. Instance did not appear to possess any other anomalous properties and the noise did not return.

> ### Test 103:
> 
> **Date:** 4/24/17
> 
> **Directive:** Same as baseline test.
> 
> **Results:** D-8245 acquired an instance of bottled, clear, and unaged whiskey. Labeled "MD Moonshine".

> ### Test 285:
> 
> **Date:** 8/6/17
> 
> **Directive:** Same as baseline test.
> 
> **Results:** D-8245 acquired a jar of "Moonlight" (pictured above). Approximate weight of the object is in line with the weight of an empty jar despite appearing to contain a solid substance.

> ### Test 513:
> 
> **Date:** 1/11/18
> 
> **Directive:** Same as baseline test, however D-8245 was directed to taste acquired instance.
> 
> **Results:** D-8245 was seated next to the aperture while researchers set up recording equipment prior to test.
> 
> A hand approximately 7 meters wide emerged from an aperture on the opposite side of the testing chamber and grasped D-8245. D-8245 began to scream and was removed from the testing chamber through that same aperture by the hand. After approximately 6 seconds D-8245's head re-entered the chamber through the new aperture. The remainder of his body was not recovered.
> 
> The newly formed aperture does not appear to have remained in place following this test.

**Note: Testing has been temporarily suspended.**
